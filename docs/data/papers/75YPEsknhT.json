Existing agent benchmarks largely ignore this practical challenge, failing to assess an agent's true capacity in cracking CAPTCHA. To bridge this gap, we comprehensively analyze the CAPTCHA distributions in the real world, and introduce MirrorCAPTCHA benchmark, annotated with Weighted Pass Rate and a novel proposed metric: Completion Degree. This benchmark is designed to serve as a ``mirror'' that accurately reflects the automation capabilities of agents in real scenarios. We filter out 2,095 websites from the Common Crawl, identifying the active CAPTCHA puzzles and classifying them into 18 distinct categories using the K-means clustering algorithm. To ensure practicality, we extract a web subgraph from Common Crawl covering these websites and employ random walks to simulate real-world CAPTCHA encounter frequencies, yielding a realistic measure of agents’ ability. Additionally, we develop a lightweight synthetic data pipeline to train a model, Ovis2-Agent-CAPTCHA-8B, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art closed-source models on the MirrorCAPTCHA benchmark, achieving a 9.4% higher average Weighted Pass Rate and a 2.13% higher average Completion Degree compared with the second-place, Gemini-2.5-Pro.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Captcha;Web Agent;Multimodal Large Language Model"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d83945be4113fe10d2c0f1fa12f054400f4b7a3e.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces MirrorCAPTCHA, a benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal LLM agents on CAPTCHA-solving tasks using real-world distributions.

CAPTCHAs exist specifically to prevent automated abuse of web services. This work essentially provides:\nA trained model that breaks security mechanisms\nA blueprint for creating CAPTCHA-breaking systems\nData collection via automated triggering of real websites' CAPTCHA.\n\n\nThe related work is short and must be extended. It would be beneficial to have explicit sections on CAPTCHA types and CAPTCHA solving. For the former, given the topic of the paper, a proper explanation of what CAPTCHA is and why they are used is needed. Also, you are using an acronym but never defining it.\nFor this, you should start with these papers:\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-39200-9_18 \nhttps://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/966389.966390 \n\nFor example, include these for the latter. \nhttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10633630 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08831) \nhttps://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2017/11/21031220/asia-16-Sivakorn-Im-Not-a-Human-Breaking-the-Google-reCAPTCHA-wp.pdf \nhttps://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2008/hash/12092a75caa75e4644fd2869f0b6c45a-Abstract.html \n\nSection 3.3 should use proper math to determine the stationary distribution, as this is well defined in probability theory. And if the authors show that they must use the iterative method, then they should show that 10^8 is sufficient and necessary. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Finite_state_space and https://stephens999.github.io/fiveMinuteStats/stationary_distribution.html. For the paper, you should cite a probability book or a similar citable source that explains the theory. You can also, in addition, use PageRank https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank. This can help make this part shorter.\n\nYour definition of and method to determine cluster types are flawed. Websites often load CAPTCHA from a given provider (e.g., hCaptcha), and the provider then has various kinds of CAPTCHA available, meaning that subsequent visits might get other types. As certain websites have much higher visit probabilities than others, these can greatly impact the weights given to the clusters.\n\nPlesner et al. 2024 [1] show that reCAPTCHAv2 can be fully solved (this corresponds to your type 1 and 2), while Bursztein et al. 2014 [2], and Noury and Rezaei 2020 [3] showed that text-based CAPTCHA can be solved. (The list of examples is not exhaustive.) \nIt would be nice to include baselines that are not MLLMs. Many agents perform best when they have tools they can call (https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/writing-tools-for-agents and https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro). How would the models perform if given tools that could solve the frequent challenges they encounter? \nAssuming the solving rates from [1-3] remain above 98% and the methods handle clusters 1-4 and 6 (there might be more relevant clusters), then the WPR would be (0.35871+0.34847+0.09175+0.03592+0.02814)×0.98=0.8457302. Thus, such a method would outperform your model by 35 percentage points.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08831 \n[2] https://www.usenix.org/conference/woot14/workshop-program/presentation/bursztein \n[3] https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08296 \n\nThere are no measurements of the time to solve a CAPTCHA.\n\nFigures 1 and 2 are hard to read. Please make the font and figures larger.\nAlso, the captions are generally short and would benefit from being expanded. The tables and figures should be understandable with almost only the caption as context. \nSubfigures in Figures 6 and 7 should be cropped only to show what is relevant, but also make the relevant parts larger.\n\nGrammar:\n“We then use a modified version WebVoyager” should be “We then use a modified version of WebVoyager” on line 151.\nCommas need to be inside the quotation marks. This is relevant for lines 381, 382, 412, etc.\n\nTypos:\nFigure 3 caption: MirrirCAPTCHA -> MirrorCAPTCHA\n\nMinor things:\nPlease sort the examples in Figure 2 so it is easier to find a specific one.\nReference Figure 2 in Table 1.\nIn Tables 1 and 2, please include a column with the CAPTCHA cluster number (i.e., row number). \nFor Table 2, make it clear that the average is the weighted average according to the visit probabilities.\nYou can remove “Categories are ordered by traffic: 1. Image Recognition, 2. Patch Select, 3. OCR Grey, 4. OCR Grid, 5. Drag Drop, 6. OCR ColorPure, 7. Image Match, 8. Rotation Match, 9. Slide Puzzle, 10. OCR ColorPattern, 11. Semantic Select, 12. Semantic Area, 13. OCR Dot, 14. Reference Match, 15. Click Order, 16. Slide Line, 17. Type Arithmetic, 18. OCR Gradient.” from the caption of Table 1.\n\n\n\nThe core idea of using real-world distributions is valuable, and the benchmark construction is ambitious. However, critical methodological flaws (clustering approach, missing baselines, inadequate probability theory) and presentation issues significantly weaken the contribution.\n\nThe current version requires major revisions; however, given IRB approval and other revisions, I will likely increase my score."}, "questions": {"value": "“The resulting corpus comprises 10,000 valid websites spanning diverse domains, including entertainment, media, and social network platforms.” How do you get the domain of a website?\n\n“Standard user actions (e.g., direct registration or login by users) often do not trigger CAPTCHA, as such actions are typically not flagged as suspicious.” You need to justify this statement, either with results or references. I have anecdotally found this not to be the case, and it contradicts what you write in the caption of Figure 3.\n\nYou define the types of CAPTCHA you find. However, what are the providers? According to this website https://trends.builtwith.com/widgets, some of the leading providers are Google reCAPTCHA, Cloudflare, and hCaptcha.\n\nHow do you handle reCAPTCHAv3 and similar ones? These do not trigger unless the user behaviour is abnormal; however, they are silent in the background and do not pose a challenge to the user. reCAPTCHAv3 uses reCAPTCHAv2 as a fallback for challenges. \nIf agent A performs poorly on reCAPTCHAv2 but very well on v3, it might still be better than agent B, which performs well on v2 but always fails/triggers v3.\n\nWhy did you go for a non-uniform sample distribution? (cf. Table 1).\n\nFor the completion degree, how do you get the ground truth labels? E.g. for images this requires hand labelling (as stated by the Breaking reCAPTCHAv2 authors in a later work: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05558) \n\nWhy is Table 3 missing several rows?\n\nHow stable is the CAPTCHA distribution over time?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["Yes, Other reasons (please specify below)"]}, "details_of_ethics_concerns": {"value": "This paper raises several interconnected ethical concerns: (1) Security/Safety.
