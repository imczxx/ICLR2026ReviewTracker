However, the security of RGB-T detectors, particularly in the physical world, has been largely overlooked. This paper proposes a novel approach to RGB-T physical attacks using adversarial clothing with a non-overlapping RGB-T pattern (NORP). To simulate full-view (0$^{\\circ}$–360$^{\\circ}$) RGB-T attacks, we construct 3D RGB-T models for human and adversarial clothing. NORP is a new adversarial pattern design using distinct visible and thermal materials without overlap, avoiding the light reduction in overlapping RGB-T patterns (ORP). To optimize the NORP on adversarial clothing, we propose a spatial discrete-continuous optimization (SDCO) method. We systematically evaluated our method on RGB-T detectors with different fusion architectures, demonstrating high attack success rates both in the digital and physical worlds. Additionally, we introduce a fusion-stage ensemble method that enhances the transferability of adversarial attacks across unseen RGB-T detectors with different fusion architectures.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Physical adversarial example", "Adversarial attack", "Multimodal learning", "Visible-Thermal (RGB-T) object detetion", "Adversarial robustness"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/5258b8c80ff0df527295ae7d4c75311f9f50d615.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/31d16368431321407c069a9491baabfe05aa0e56.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the overlooked physical-world security of RGB-T detectors by proposing adversarial clothing based on a Non-Overlapping RGB-T Pattern.

The evaluation omits newer multimodal and RGB-only physical attacks that employ differentiable rendering, optimization under lighting/EOT constraints, or diffusion-based perturbations (e.g., Adv3D, PRoCA, DiffusionPatch). Without benchmarking against these, it is unclear whether NORP’s improvements stem from its novel discretization strategy or simply from stronger optimization.\n- The paper acknowledges visual realism but offers limited quantitative or human-subjective evaluation. Since clothing-based attacks must balance stealth with adversarial efficacy, user studies or perceptual metrics (LPIPS, FID, or texture-similarity) would help verify that NORP remains inconspicuous to humans. Current qualitative figures are promising but insufficient for claims of “naturalness”.\n- The evaluation defines attack success using IoU = 0.5 and confidence ≥ 0.6. This relatively strict threshold may exaggerate the apparent success rate, especially since modern detectors often report low-confidence bounding boxes that still indicate detection. A sensitivity analysis over thresholds (e.g., 0.3–0.7) would show how robust the reported ASR is to this design choice."}, "questions": {"value": "Please check weaknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 5}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "CmgFxnVsJw", "forum": "KMtLgvt7mb", "replyto": "KMtLgvt7mb", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7717/Reviewer_B9rf"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7717/Reviewer_B9rf"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7717/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761843353020, "cdate": 1761843353020, "tmdate": 1762919772779, "mdate": 1762919772779, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}}, "id": "xfcbX4DhmQ", "forum": "KMtLgvt7mb", "replyto": "KMtLgvt7mb", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7717/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7717/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762930188785, "cdate": 1762930188785, "tmdate": 1762930188785, "mdate": 1762930188785, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a physical adversarial clothing method to evade RGB-T object detectors.
