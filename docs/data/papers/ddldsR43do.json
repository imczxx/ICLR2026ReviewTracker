However, most existing methods rely on static distribution assumptions, while overlooking the latent causal structures and structural shifts that underlie real-world temporal dynamics. This often leads to poor explanation of anomalies and misclassification of environment-induced variations. To address these shortcomings, we propose Causal Soft Jump Diffusion Anomaly Detection (CSJD-AD), a novel framework that models both latent dynamics and soft-gated expected jumps through a structural jump diffusion process. We adopt a causal perspective grounded in environment-conditioned invariance by inferring discrete environment states and conditioning the jump-augmented process on them, yielding a practical detector for unlabeled sensor streams without aiming to identify true interventions. By generating paired counterfactual and factual trajectories, the model explicitly contrasts causally consistent behavior with unexplained deviations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmark datasets, demonstrating the importance of incorporating causal reasoning and jump-aware dynamics into time series anomaly detection.", "tldr": "We incorporated environment-aware variables into a jump–diffusion SDE and leveraged the contrast between counterfactual and factual generative trajectories to achieve precise anomaly detection.", "keywords": ["Time series", "Anomaly detection", "Jump diffusion", "Causal modeling"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b48c8794efb553bb8281986c05c9d934b51cb592.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces a causal jump-diffusion framework for time series anomaly detection.

Each environment defines its own drift, diffusion, and jump parameters, enabling the model to capture regime-dependent behaviors. During training, the model simulates a counterfactual path using drift–diffusion only and a factual path with the soft-jump term, blends them through a factor $\\gamma$, and reconstructs the observation through a decoder. A causal contrastive loss regularizes the distance between factual and counterfactual paths weighted by the jump magnitude and gate, while KL and entropy regularizers constrain latent distributions.
