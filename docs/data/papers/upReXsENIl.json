The Rate-Distortion function is the lowest rate possible for a code whose decoding allows a given amount of such distortion.\nWe exploit the connection between rate-distortion (RD) and entropic optimal transport to propose a novel stochastic control formulation, and use a classic result dating back to Schrödinger to show that the tradeoff between rate and mean squared error distortion is equivalent to a tradeoff between control energy and the differential entropy of the terminal state, whose probability law yields the reconstruction distribution. For a special class of sources, we show that the optimal control law and trajectory in the space of probability measures are given by solving a backward heat equation. In the more general case, our approach gives rise to a numerical solution method, estimating the RD function using diffusion processes with a constant diffusion coefficient.

The approach focuses on the case where the data source is continuous, and the average distortion is quadratic, $D(X, \\hat{X})=\\tfrac{1}{2} \\mathbb{E}[\\| X - \\hat{X} \\|^2]$. Then, the problem reduces to an entropic optimal transport problem, which, in the low distortion regime, can be mapped to a Schrödinger bridge problem. Through this chain of reasoning the task of determining $R(D)$ is converted to a free energy minimization problem, which the authors refer to as _terminal-entropy stochastic control_, wherein the optimal rate corresponds to a balance between control energy and terminal state uncertainty. This optimum can be determined by parameterizing the control with a neural network and scanning through the free-energy landscape, which R2D2 algorithm presented in the paper. Experiments with some mixture distributions and the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate the algorithm at work."}, "soundness": {"value": 4}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

The authors state that their approach is restricted to quadratic distortion, and the low-distortion regime. Why is this corner interesting from a practical standpoint? Or was it chosen because it makes the problem tractable? The paper would benefit from motivating this choice early on.\n\n2. In its present state, the paper reads like a stochastic control paper which shows that the rate-distortion function is the minimum of a free energy functional. The numerical solution to the latter involves a neural network. Beyond this, the paper makes no wider connection to machine learning in general. See my second question below.\n\n3. Per my understanding, the method does not scale well to higher dimensions. The main bottleneck is the estimation of $H(X_1)$, as explained in appendix B of the paper. If this is an actual limitation it should be highlighted earlier in the paper. See my third question below.\n\n4. Not really a weakness, but the derivations in Sec. 3.2 appears to be mostly a special case of the one presented in [1]. Include this reference.\n\nMinor comment about formatting: The captions for the subfigures in Figure 1 could be spaced apart more for readability.\nMinor comment about references: I encourage you to cite [4], which is an English translation of Schrodinger's paper 'On the reversal of the laws of nature.'"}, "questions": {"value": "1. The core arguments of the paper bear a strong resemblance to the _adjoint-matching_ paper from last year [2]. Briefly, given samples of a distribution $p_{\\rm base}$ that paper addresses the problem of sampling from the tilted distribution $e^{r(x)} p_{\\rm base}$. It seems to me that this is also a form of distortion. While $r(x)$ is fixed in their case, making it free may allow their argument to be extended to some class of distortions besides the one addressed in your paper. Could this be an interesting direction for follow-up work?\n\n2. The terminal entropy stochastic control picture in Sec. 5 looks a lot like max-entropy RL, which you mention in the introduction. Both problems extremize an expected cost (or distortion) while regularizing by an entropy. Does this speak to a deeper connection between compression and learning? Is it correct to say that _the optimal policy is the most efficient compressor of the admissible solutions at a fixed cost_? Sharpening such connections could make the paper much more compelling.\n\n3. On the difficulty of determining $H(X_1)$ in high-dimensions, if you are simulating the trajectories for different $u_\\theta$ in Algorithm 1, is it possible to use the samples at $t=1$ to compute that entropy, say with the approach from [3] you cited?\n\n4. Around line 207, what does it mean when you write $W_0^\\epsilon \\sim \\mathbb{P}_0$? If $\\mathbb{P}_0$ denotes the source distribution, is $W_0^\\epsilon$ the initial state under a small diffusion of it?\n\nOverall I think this is a good paper that can be further improved with some minor changes.

I do not see a reason why numerical experiments on one-dimensional Gaussian data and CIFAR-10 were not attached as a supplement. This raises concerns about reproducibility of the results reported in Section 5.\n\n2. It seems that the authors missed a very relevant paper [Dai Pra, 1991], where the author studied the problem of stochastic optimal control. His findings were recently applied to generative modelling (see, for instance, [Rapakoulias et al., 2023] and [Puchkin et al., 2025]). I suppose that the proof of Theorem 3.2 in the present submission can be simplified if the authors took into account Theorem 3.2 from [Dai Pra, 1991], where the author derived an explicit expression of the optimal control function $u^\\star(x, t)$ for a fixed $\\mathbb P_1$ through Schrodinger potentials (see, e.g., [Korotin et al., 2024] for the definition). I would be grateful if the authors could elaborate on this point.\n\n3. In the suggested algorithm, one has to optimize both the terminal distribution $\\mathbb P_1$ and the control $u(x, t)$. However, for any fixed $\\mathbb P_1$ the form of the optimal control $u^\\star(x, t)$ is known (see Theorem 3.2 in [Dai Pra, 1991]). Moreover, Dai Pra [1991] derives the corresponding value of $(2\\varepsilon)^{-1} \\mathbb E \\int_0^1 \\|u^*(x, t)\\|^2 \\, dt$. Hence, the loss can be substantially simplified.\n\nIn view of the weaknesses 2 and 3, I would not recommend the paper for acceptance in its present form. I think that it will benefit from a revision, if the authors take into account the results of Dai Pra.\n\n\n**Minor remark**\n\nOn page 4 the authors write: ``Recent developments (Gushchin et al., 2022) has drawn an equivalency (up to an additive constant, depends on $\\mathbb P_0$ , $\\mathbb P_1$ , $\\varepsilon$) between SB and EOT, where the latter can be optimized via a game-theoretic formulation.'' The connection between SB and EOT was known far before (Gushchin et al., 2022). In particular, it was mentioned in the survey of Leonard (2013).\n\n**References**\n\n[Dai Pra, 1991] Paolo Dai Pra.
