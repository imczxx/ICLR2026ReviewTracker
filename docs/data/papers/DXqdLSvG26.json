This capability is critical for system performance. A directly motivated example is the mitigation of phantom traffic jams, where string stability can suppress stop-and-go wave propagation. In this paper, we first establish a sufficient condition for scalable input-to-state stability (sISS), providing a theoretical guarantee for string stability. The derived conditions reveal a coupled shrinking relationship among the energy of different agents in the system, which depend on local Lyapunov functions but guarantee the global condition of sISS. Based on this theoretical foundation, we propose a practical and effective algorithm, named multi-agent Lyapunov actor-critic (MALAC), to achieve stable control in networked systems.

I leave the relevance part to the area chairs but below are my technical concerns.\n\n1. The theorem assumes inequalities on local Lyapunov functions and coupling coefficients with disturbance terms, while training uses a soft penalty with a fixed margin $\\epsilon$. There is no certification that the final policy satisfies the theorem on the true closed loop with bounded disturbances. No constraint-violation statistics are reported.\n\n2. Replacing a disturbance energy term by a constant $\\epsilon$ ignores variation in disturbance magnitude. Feasibility can silently fail as conditions change, and there is no adaptive scheme.\n\n3. Fixing $c_{i,j}=1/(|\\mathcal N_i|+1)$ ensures the sum is below one but does not yield explicit slack $c>0$ or account for approximation error. No projection step enforces $\\sum_j c_{i,j} \\le 1 - c\\Delta t$ with known slack.\n\n4. The plots show trajectories and costs, but there is no quantitative string-stability metric such as amplification ratios, empirical $\\mathcal L_2$ or $\\mathcal L_\\infty$ gains, frequency-response attenuation, or estimated $\\beta,\\gamma$ bounds.\n\n5. The experiments are small $N$, single lane, idealized sensing and communication. No heterogeneity, sensor noise, actuation limits, V2V delays or dropouts, or mixed human drivers. No scaling to $N \\ge 50$.\n\n6. The baselines ACC and CACC are weak for comparison. Comparison with strong control baselines such as SAC or Lyapunov-constrained RL and certificate-based methods would make the paper stronger,\n\n7. The ablation study is limited. Ablations removing the Lyapunov term, learning vs fixing $c_{i,j}$, sensitivity to $\\Delta t$, entropy targets, neighbor aggregation, or penalty would tremendously improve the quality of the paper\n\n8.
