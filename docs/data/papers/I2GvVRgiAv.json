Most existing unsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable cross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these methods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node distinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the misalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature heterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node correspondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that simultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency across latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both structure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space misalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring consistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive experiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior robustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios. Additionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using diverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes beyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language representations.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Graph alignment", "Graph matching", "Graph neural network", "Latent space alignment", "Graph autoencoder", "Vision-language alignment", "Functional maps"], "primary_area": "learning on graphs and other geometries & topologies", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/3384771f2f9f84962cc1675b199345b32ff1975d.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper tackles unsupervised graph alignment and proposes Graph Alignment via Dual-pass encoder and Latent-space communication (GADL), which has two key parts: (i) a dual-pass spectral encoder that concatenates low-pass and high-pass GCN branches to balance structural smoothness and node distinctiveness; and (ii) a geometry-aware functional map module that aligns the two latent spaces.

However, there are a few theoretical assumptions and limitations worth discussing. The following points stem from my own analysis:\n\n1. The framework relies on the strong assumption of a linear relationship between latent spaces. Ideally, if the ground-truth node permutation is Π, we would expect Z_t ≈ Π Z_s R, where R is an orthogonal matrix. The functional map aims to learn C by minimizing ||C F_s - F_t||_F^2, where F_s = U_s^T Z_s and F_t = U_t^T Z_t are the spectral projections.\n   However, what if the true relationship between the spaces is non-linear, e.g., Z_t ≈ Π g(Z_s), where g(·) is a non-linear function? In this case, the model attempts to fit a non-linear relationship with a linear operator C. The optimal linear solution, C_opt = F_t F_s^+ (where + denotes the pseudo-inverse), might result in a large residual ||C_opt F_s - F_t||^2. Does this imply that the linear alignment may be unable to perfectly capture non-linear geometric distortions between the spaces?\n2. The method's reliance on the Laplacian eigenbasis can be a concern when the graph Laplacian has degenerate (repeated) eigenvalues, which is common in symmetric graphs. In such cases, the corresponding eigenvector basis is not unique, and minor graph perturbations can lead to drastic changes in the basis.\n   For instance, let L have a degenerate eigenvalue λ_i = λ_{i+1} with corresponding eigenvectors u_i, u_{i+1}. Then, for any orthogonal matrix Q ∈ R^{2x2}, [u'_i, u'_{i+1}] = [u_i, u_{i+1}] Q is also a valid basis for that eigenspace. A small perturbation ΔG leads to L' = L + ΔL, which can break this degeneracy. According to matrix perturbation theory, even if ||ΔL|| is small, the new eigenvectors u'_i, u'_{i+1} can be drastically different from (nearly orthogonal to) the original basis. Since the spectral features F = U^T Z directly depend on U, an unstable spectral basis could lead to unstable spectral features, thereby affecting the learning of the functional map C.\n   I would encourage the authors to discuss this potential issue. For example, they could analyze why this has a limited impact on real-world networks (perhaps due to their low symmetry) or argue that the framework's strong performance itself is evidence of its robustness to such spectral basis perturbations."}, "questions": {"value": "See the discussion of weakness"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 8}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "0X0IzasiyV", "forum": "I2GvVRgiAv", "replyto": "I2GvVRgiAv", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12774/Reviewer_qCNv"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12774/Reviewer_qCNv"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission12774/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761982021333, "cdate": 1761982021333, "tmdate": 1762923585688, "mdate": 1762923585688, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
