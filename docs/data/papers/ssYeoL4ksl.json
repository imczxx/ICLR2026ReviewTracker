Numerous methods have been proposed to identify causal relationships from observational data, but they often assume that the causal model is acyclic and all variables are observed. Those methods risk yielding misleading or spurious causal relationships when confronted with the challenges posed by cycles and latent variables. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that leverages higher-order cumulants to recover the causal structure among observed variables, even in the presence of cycles and latent variables. Specifically, we construct two cumulant matrices that incorporate various (joint) cumulants of the observed variables. By utilizing these matrices, we provide identifiability theories that determine the existence of cycles and latent variables based on the rank differences of the constructed cumulant matrix, and determine the causal relationship between two observed variables. This innovative method provides a robust framework for accurate causal discovery in complex systems with inherent cyclic and latent structures. Experimental results in simulated and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Causal Discovery", "latent variables", "cyclic  model"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/21e9f592112bc94821378f40d386daf5517fac85.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a causal discovery method utilizing higher-order statistical features that can simultaneously identify no edge, unidirectional causality, and feedback loops between two variables using only observational data, while accounting for potential confounding factors; it outperforms multiple baselines on both simulated and real-world data."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "- The research problem is important and practically significant.

Although the method iteratively increases $m,k_1,k_2$, there is no theoretical guarantee under misspecified orders.

The paper does not clarify whether this can occur. \n\n1.1 Empirically, the iterative procedure appears favorable in the reported experiments because the initialization matches the ground truth; consequently, when this holds, no substantive iteration occurs. Please first verify this by reporting the order values at termination for the conducted experiments. Please then further provide evidence that the method still works when the initial values are misspecified.\n\n2. The proposed algorithm focuses on pairwise causal relations, leaving its applicability to general causal graphs unclear.

From the experimental results, the CCI baseline appears sensitive to the noise distribution, which is reasonable given its reliance on conditional independence tests.
