While several automated evaluation methods exist for SAEs, most rely on external LLMs. In this work, we introduce CE-Bench, a novel and lightweight contrastive evaluation benchmark for sparse autoencoders, built on a curated dataset of contrastive story pairs. We conduct comprehensive evaluation studies to validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our results show that CE-Bench reliably measures the interpretability of sparse autoencoders and aligns well with existing benchmarks without requiring an external LLM judge, achieving over 70% Spearman correlation with results in SAEBench.

To construct the benchmark, the authors introduce a dataset of contrastive pairs of stories.

The overall quality metric combines these scores with a sparsity penalty; with appropriate hyperparameter tuning, this metric correlates moderately with the SAEBench quality metric introduced in prior work."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

Additionally, the work does not, in this reviewer's opinion, make substantial progress on an important problem.\n1. Importance. This paper introduces 2 metrics of SAE quality (contrastive score and independence score). Neither of these stand out as being especially unique as possible SAE quality metrics (e.g. they don't capture usefulness for a downstream task). The provided motivation is eliminating the need for LLM-grading; however, (a) this seems more like a nice-to-have than an especially important property and (b) existing metrics like the sparse probing metric from SAEBench already satisfy this property. (For context, SAEBench comprised seven metrics.) So overall, even if well-executed, it's not clear that this work would be sufficiently important for acceptance in a top-tier venue.\n2. The introduced metrics don't clearly relate to interpretability. The contrastive and independence scores measure basic properties of representational geometry—specifically, whether some dimension exhibits large variance between particular examples or relative to a dataset mean. However, the paper provides no justification for why these geometric properties should correspond to interpretability. In fact, we see the opposite: without an explicit sparsity penalty, denser SAEs score higher. Given this, it's likely that random up-projections, SAEs with random weights, or just using the base model's activations would score more highly on the metrics introduced here, despite being clearly less interpretable. More importantly, the authors never validate that latents with high contrastive or independence scores actually encode the intended semantic concepts. \n4. Contrastive story generation seems dubious. Typically the goal of a contrastive pair (x, y) is for x and y to be as similar as possible except for differing with respect to a single concept of interest. That does not seem to be the case in the data introduced here. Looking at the example in table 4, the two stories both make clear reference to the concept with respect to which they're supposed to differ (computer) while varying in many other unrelated ways.\n5.

If not, that suggests the contrastive pair structure in your data was not load-bearing.\n3.

It is not clear what value this provides as an SAE benchmark that k-sparse probing does not provide.\n- The overall formula is unprincipled (summing 2 scores and subtracting sparsity with a coefficient just to make the numbers match SAEBench empirically). The sparsity component of this is particularly egregious; we want SAEs that are interpretable, we do not care about sparsity. We should not penalize SAEs that are interpretable for not being sparse. There is no inherent value to sparsity.\n- The paper selects only a single SAE neuron to evaluate the difference between contrastive prompts. This assumes that the prompts differ in only a single dimension, and that this dimension corresponds to a LLM feature the SAE has captured. This makes this technique more limited than k-sparse probing. A `topk` instead of a `max` should be used, better aligning with k-sparse probing that SAEs are usually evaluated with.\n- No error bars or stdev is provided for evaluations, and they appear very noisy, e.g. Figure 2\n- The validity of the metric is not evaluated in and of itself, but only as a proxy to SAEBench's auto-interp score.

In general it would help to write these operations in math notation.\n- The metric described here is not being compared to SAEBench as a whole, which comprises a number of metrics, but only the auto-interp score.

If an SAE performs well in discerning the contrastive pairs in the dataset, how confident are we this generalizes to other topics not contained in the dataset?
