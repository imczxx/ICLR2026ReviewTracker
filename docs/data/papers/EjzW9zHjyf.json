To my understanding, the claimed primary contribution of this paper is a proof that the Sinkhorn algorithm can be applied to graphs with bounded treewidth $\\tau$ in $\\widetilde{O}(n\\tau)$ time.  I believe it is known that the Sinkhorn algorithm for matrix scaling converges if and only if the matrix has total support; see e.g. ``Concerning Nonnegative Matrices and Doubly Stochastic Matrices\" by Sinkhorn and Knopp 1967. So the proof that Sinkhorn converges should be straightforward? If this is true, then the main contribution lies in the compressed representation of the transport plan which allows one to execute each iteration of Sinkhorn in $O(n\\tau)$ time. But it is known by [BGHK95] that an implicit representation exists and can be computed quickly. Clarity on the authors' contributions would be much appreciated. It would be helpful if the authors clarify any other challenges  that they address in this work.  \n|\nThe authors claim on line 72 that ``in practical settings, treewidth tends to be small\" and provide one example reference to power system analysis data. Do they have other examples to reference? When and why should one expect treewidth to be small in practice?  This is important because Sinkhorn often requires quadratic time ibecause t it is assumed one is given all $O(n^2)$ pairwise distances.\n|\nCan  the Cholesky factorization be computed efficiently in parallel.
