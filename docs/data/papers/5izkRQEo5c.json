Several fintech startups have sought to address this challenge by developing alternative credit scoring methodologies leveraging artificial intelligence and non-traditional data sources. This paper presents a novel approach that applies computer vision techniques to Instagram images and videos from microbusiness accounts, extracting visual features to improve predictive models of creditworthiness. The proposed method utilizes pre-trained vision language models, such as CLIP and X-CLIP, to obtain visual embeddings. Subsequently, dimensionality reduction (UMAP) and clustering (KMeans) techniques are applied to derive discriminative features. In addition, two distinct architectures are introduced: a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) processing CLIP embeddings, and a separate Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) directly analyzing image data, each generating predictive visual scores. Preliminary results show that visual embeddings improved AUC by 2.16 points and F1-score by 9.86 points, with visual features contributing 25.52\\% of predictive power—underscoring the potential impact of computer vision-based methodologies on financial inclusion among underserved communities.", "tldr": "We leverage Instagram images and videos to enhance credit scoring models for informal microbusinesses, improving predictive accuracy and supporting financial inclusion.", "keywords": ["Alternative Credit Scoring; Financial Inclusion; Informal Microbusinesses; Instagram Data; Computer Vision; Visual Embeddings."], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/ad79cbaf7a572176a7977e1a5ad7822bf342d2a8.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses the challenge of limited access to formal credit for informal microbusinesses in Latin America.

Novelty and Significance : The paper proposes a novel approach to credit scoring by integrating computer vision pipelines applied to Instagram data. This is particularly important because it targets informal microbusinesses in Latin America, addressing a substantial credit gap. Leveraging digital footprints and visual semantics to assess credit risk is an innovative application of representation learning.\n2. Empirical Results : The study provides clear evidence of significant performance enhancement, notably an increase of 2.16 percentage points in AUC and a substantial 9.86 percentage points in F1-score. Furthermore, the finding that visual features account for 25.52% of the overall predictive power underscores their substantial contribution to enhanced model performance.\n3. Robust and Complex Technical Methodology : The methodology is technically sophisticated, combining multiple machine learning techniques: using pre-trained vision-language models, UMAP and KMeans to derive features, and deploying CNN and FCNN to generate dual visual scores. The use of a custom evaluation metric that prioritizes AUC maximization while penalizing high default rates and encouraging class separation  demonstrates a deep understanding of practical credit risk objectives."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Limited Sample Size and Generalization Constraints : The results stem from a modest, Colombia-centric sample of only 570 microbusinesses. The test set is particularly small, consisting of only 44 users, which the authors acknowledge that this ‘limits statistical reliability’. This severely limits the statistical reliability and generalizability of the findings across Latin America or other platforms.\n2. Coarse Granularity of Credit Behavior Labels : The dataset uses a simple binary classification system, labeling borrowers as either 'good payer' or 'poor payer'. The authors concede that this binary approach may blur finer shades of credit behavior. They recommend, as future work, the adoption of multi-level delinquency labels to capture credit behavior more accurately.\n3. Potential Sector-Selection Bias : The dataset exhibits an uneven distribution of business categories. The largest categories each account for 19%, while Agriculture and Electronics combined account for less than 5%. This high concentration in specific sectors may introduce a sector-selection bias, making the model's performance potentially less reliable for underrepresented industries."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Custom Evaluation Metric Weights and Sensitivity : The custom evaluation metric used for optimizing the XGBoost model includes four weights. What were the specific numerical values chosen for these weights during the hyperparameter tuning process? Furthermore, were any sensitivity analyses performed to assess how changes in these weights impacted the final performance metrics?\n2. Contribution of Visual Modalities : Visual features contributed 25.52% of the total predictive power. The proposed methodology utilizes both clustering-derived features and neural scores. Can the authors provide a targeted breakdown: Which of these visual components contributed the most to the overall 25.52% improvement?\n3. Justification for Extreme FCNN Dropout Rates : The FCNN architecture implemented to refine CLIP embeddings uses exceptionally high dropout probabilities in its layers to prevent overfitting. Given the small size of the training set and the validation set, this level of regularization seems extreme. What experimental evidence or specific metrics justified the adoption of such high dropout rates, and how was the potential loss of model capacity assessed?\n4. Embedding Space Alignment : The approach uses CLIP for images and X-CLIP for videos, both yielding 512-dimensional embeddings. Were these two distinct embedding spaces subject to any alignment or normalization process before the features were concatenated and integrated into the final XGBoost model? Additionally, why was the optimal number of clusters significantly different (40 for images versus 80 for videos)?\n5. Temporal Performance and Concept Drift: The dataset uses an out-of-time strategy across a 2022–2024 period to ensure temporal validity. Considering economic and social changes over two years, there is a risk of concept drift. What analysis was conducted to confirm that the model, trained on older data, maintained stable or consistent predictive performance when tested specifically on the newest subset of data in the test set?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 4}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "NKK61jadYR", "forum": "5izkRQEo5c", "replyto": "5izkRQEo5c", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21875/Reviewer_o2Fb"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21875/Reviewer_o2Fb"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21875/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761808789790, "cdate": 1761808789790, "tmdate": 1762941966558, "mdate": 1762941966558, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes using visual embeddings from Instagram posts to enhance credit scoring for informal microbusinesses in Latin America.
