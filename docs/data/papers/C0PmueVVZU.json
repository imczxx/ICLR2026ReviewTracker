Latent drivers, such as atmospheric processes, play a critical role in temporal dynamics, while direct causal influences also exist among geographically proximate observed variables. Traditional Causal Representation Learning (CRL) typically focuses on latent factors but overlooks such observable-to-observable causal relations, limiting its applicability to climate analysis. \nIn this paper, we introduce a unified framework that jointly uncovers (i) causal relations among observed variables and (ii) latent driving forces together with their interactions. We establish conditions under which both the hidden dynamic processes and the causal structure among observed variables are simultaneously identifiable from time-series data. Remarkably, our guarantees hold even in the nonparametric setting, leveraging contextual information to recover latent variables and observable relations. \nBuilding on these insights, we propose CaDRe (Causal Discovery and Representation learning), a time-series generative model with structural constraints that integrates CRL and causal discovery. Experiments on synthetic datasets validate our theoretical results. On real-world climate datasets, CaDRe not only delivers competitive forecasting accuracy but also recovers visualized causal graphs aligned with domain expertise, thereby offering interpretable insights into climate systems.", "tldr": "We develop a theoretical framework and an estimation approach simultaneously learning both the causal structures over observed variables and latent process for climate analysis.", "keywords": ["Climate Analysis; Causal Discovery; Causal Representation Learning"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1815d1700b61ecfb19c5fcc94a97488345ade67a.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/3ed86034265ad64c6ff128351912797a2c2512f1.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Motivated by applications in climate science where latent driving forces affect a non-stationary process,\nthis work addresses time series data where causal interactions exist not only among observed variables but also\namong a set of latent variables, either time-lagged or instantaneous.

Strong theoretical results. Clear identifiability theorems/lemmas that theoretically demonstrate the recoverability of both latent drivers and observable causal edges. The ability to simultaneously identify latent and observable effects is very important in climate modeling studies, where many latent processes can drive global climate patterns. Furthermore, these results directly lead to a new state-space generative model, with structural constraints, derived from the theory.\n\n2. Comprehensive evaluations.. Synthetic and real climate datasets demonstrate that this approach works to recover causal structures in a wide range of settings. External checks that related the recovered structure to physical patterns (e.g. wind-direction maps) was an interesting surrogate for the true causal structure, which is unknown.\n\n3. Relevance: Latent confounding and time-lagged dependencies are central challenges in climate analysis; bringing identifiability guarantees to this setting is valuable and future works can build upon this approach (both the VAE method and the theory).\n\n4. Generally clear and well structured. The paper is well positioned relative to constraint-based time-series causal discovery (e.g., PCMCI) and latent-confounder settings, and it explains why a generative approach is helpful here. Mathematics are presented very rigorously."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Assumptions should to be mapped to climate data to support general claims. The main causal assumptions (e.g., forms of sparsity/locality, faithfulness/functional-faithfulness, injectivity/regularity conditions used in the proofs) are all very reasonable in an abstract sense, but its possible that they do not hold in climate data. The paper would be stronger with brief, data-driven diagnostics (or sensitivity analyses already in the appendix moved forward) showing these assumptions are approximately satisfied, or at least not grossly violated, on the real datasets used.\n\n2. Role of forecasting vs identification. Short lead forecasting results are presented as evidence of practical value, but the paper’s primary contribution is causal identification in climate models. Please clarify the conceptual link: do better graph-recovery metrics predict better forecast skill, or is forecasting simply a secondary demonstration? Without an explicit link, the forecasting section risks diluting the identification story, especially since short lead forecasting is not feature of climate models that are more concerned with multi-decade scale distributions.\n\n3. The paper introduces an additional variable (e.g., s / “s-encoder” noise or context term) with an important role in the generative model and technical details. Its definition and interpretation arrive late and somewhat tersely. Because s impacts identifiability conditions and estimation, it should be defined earlier in plain language, with a short discussion of plausibility in climate data.\n\n4. Scalability and dimensional effects. The structure-recovery metrics degrade as the number of observed variables grows (Table 2), and real climate data (e.g. CMIP models and reanalysis data) often have dimensions in the hundreds or more. Does this method scale to high resolution data and, if not, are there any constraints (e.g., masks/regularization) that might help it perform in higher dimensions?\n\n5. Teleconnections. Given that teleconnections are one of the most well known and well studied causal-like structures in climate, it would be very interesting to see how well this model does in recovering known teleconnections (e.g. ENSO related ones)."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Are there any standard / simple diagnostic checks that could be performed on the real climate data to show that the causal assumptions on not grossly violated? Given the sensitivity results in Table A11, these kinds of checks (even heuristic checks) would be helpful for ensuring the appropriateness of the model.\n\n2. How well does this approach scale when the dimension continuous to increase? I can see that the F1 score and other metrics degrade with dimension, but I'm curious if these plateau or if they converge to zero with increasing dimension; and also how increasing dimension effects the run time. For example, PCMCI can become quite slow at higher dimensions depending on the conditional information tests used. Would this method be applicable to something like ERA5 reanalysis data without significant coarsening?\n\n3. The real-data validation uses wind-field alignment and qualitative climate consistency. Have you evaluated whether CaDRe recovers canonical teleconnections (e.g., ENSO-related patterns) on SST/pressure fields? These results could be another very useful external validity check.\n\n4. The introduction states that latent drivers ​“such as pressure and precipitation,” are not directly measured. Since both pressure and precipitation are widely observed, did you mean that their driving processes are latent, or that the relevant vertical-level/large-scale drivers are unobserved?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 8}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "B4iOlfC9bE", "forum": "C0PmueVVZU", "replyto": "C0PmueVVZU", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9926/Reviewer_5w99"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9926/Reviewer_5w99"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9926/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761965880184, "cdate": 1761965880184, "tmdate": 1762921380365, "mdate": 1762921380365, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposed a causal discovery method for time series data to learn causal structures among the observed variables and latent factors.
