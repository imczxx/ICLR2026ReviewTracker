Progress is further hindered by the scarcity of high-quality and expressive demonstrations. To address this, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework for paralinguistic-aware S2S, ParaS2S, which evaluates and optimizes both content and speaking style directly at the waveform level. We first construct ParaS2SBench, a benchmark comprehensively evaluates S2S models’ output for content and style appropriateness from diverse and challenging input queries. It scores the fitness of input-output pairs and aligns well with human judgements, serving as an automatic judge for model outputs. With this scalable scoring feedback, we enable the model to explore and learn from diverse unlabeled speech via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments show that existing S2S models fail to respond appropriately to paralinguistic attributes, performing no better than pipeline-based baselines. Our RL approach achieves a 11% relative improvement in response content and style’s appropriateness on ParaS2SBench over supervised fine-tuning (SFT), surpassing all prior models while requiring substantially fewer warm-up annotations than pure SFT.", "tldr": "Unlocking paralinguistic-aware speech-to-speech interaction through self-improvement via reinforcement learning", "keywords": ["Speech-to-Speech", "Spoken Dialogues", "LLM", "benchmark", "RL", "RLAIF", "GRPO"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/93c325c13df392eece0ce09dc3b82490993180b0.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework to enhance the capability of paralinguistic cues for speech-to-speech (S2S) dialogue model.

The paper should clarify what criteria define “closeness” to human evaluation and why they are reasonable.
