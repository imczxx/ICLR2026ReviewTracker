Prior works (UniDexGrasp, UniDexGrasp++, and ResDex) show that directly running PPO on 3200 DexGraspNet objects results in poor success rates (typically 10%~60%) due to the inherent multi-task optimization challenge.\n- Even if the results are reliable, the improvement of PPO with action chunking compared with vanilla PPO is quite minor (from 90% to 93%). Simply increasing the training time of vanilla PPO may leads to the same gain.\n- The claim that \"ACPPO improves exploration with temporally coherent, smooth actions\" (line 311-318) may not be true. Since the policy parameters are trained from scratch and the Gaussian randomness for each action dimension is independent, the policy is not encouraged to output temporally coherent actions no matter action chunking is used. The cited works (line 307-310) are either imitation learning or offline-to-online RL works and their policies are initially trained from high-quality demonstrations where actions are smooth and temporally coherent. Therefore, these works cannot induce the same claim in this paper under the RL-from-scratch setting.\n- Experimental results are not comprehensive. Though action-chunking may not succeed in locomotion tasks, the ACPPO proposed in this paper is not specifically designed for the grasping task. As a general purpose algorithm design, evaluation on more tasks (such as manipulation tasks in the Meta-World benchmark) is quite necessary.

However, the empirical results (Table 4) show that the best performance is achieved with a minimal chunk size of $h=2$. Performance degrades at $h=3$ and $h=4$, and collapses to 0% at $h=8$. A chunk of 2 barely qualifies as \"temporally coherent\" and undermines the core motivation. The paper would be far more convincing if it could demonstrate SOTA performance with a more substantial chunk length (e.g., $h \\ge 5$).\n\n* **Limited Methodological Novelty:** The proposed change, while elegant, is a single modification to the PPO objective. The core components (actor-critic architecture, $V(s)$ critic, GAE) are identical to PPO. The contribution is essentially replacing the per-step IS ratio $\\rho_t$ with a chunked IS ratio $\\rho_{t,h}^{ch}$. For an ICLR submission, this level of technical contribution is borderline.\n\n* **Shallow Analysis of Failure Mode:** The paper's analysis of the $h=8$ failure is shallow, attributing it to a \"coarse\" decision frequency (a behavioral explanation). A more critical optimization-based analysis is missing. A far more likely culprit is the **instability of the chunked importance sampling ratio**. The variance of an IS ratio grows exponentially with the sequence length ($h$). It is highly probable that for $h=8$, the ratio $\\rho_{t,h=8}^{ch}$ is so volatile that it is *always* outside the PPO clipping range $[1-\\epsilon, 1+\\epsilon]$. This would cause the clipping mechanism to **zero out the gradient signal**, making learning impossible. This suggests that on-policy, IS-based methods like PPO may be fundamentally unsuited for large chunk sizes—a critical limitation that is not addressed.\n\n* **Unverified Theoretical Claims:** The authors claim (Eq. 12) that their formulation reduces the \"tail bias\" from GAE. This is a key justification for their specific objective function, yet it is presented without any empirical validation. An experiment measuring the advantage estimation bias (e.g., relative to Monte Carlo returns) for PPO vs. ACPPO would be required to substantiate this claim.\n\n* **Missing Diagnostic Experiments:** Given the hypothesis about the clipping mechanism, a crucial experiment is missing: a plot of the\n **percentage of clipped updates** as a function of the chunk size $h$. This single experiment would provide vital insight into the algorithm's optimization dynamics and likely confirm why $h=8$ fails.\n\n* **Limited Scope:** The empirical validation is confined to a single, albeit difficult, task family. The authors admit in Section 6.4 that the method would likely fail in dynamic tasks (e.g., locomotion), limiting its generality."}, "questions": {"value": "1.  How do the authors reconcile the \"temporal coherence\" motivation with the empirical fact that the minimal chunk $h=2$ is optimal?\n\n2.  Please provide a plot of the **percentage of clipped updates** vs. chunk size $h$ (from $h=1$ to $h=8$). Does this confirm the hypothesis that the $h=8$ gradient is zeroed out by the clipping mechanism?\n\n3.  Can the authors provide empirical evidence for their claim (Eq. 12) that ACPPO reduces GAE's \"tail bias\"? A direct measurement of advantage estimation error would be convincing.\n\n4.
