Conventional RF filter design process involves manual calculations of design parameters, followed by intuition-guided iterations to achieve the desired response for a set of filter specifications. This process is time-consuming due to time- and resource-intensive electromagnetic simulations using full-wave numerical PDE solvers, and requires many intuition-guided adjustments to achieve an practically usable design. This process is also highly sensitive to domain expertise and requires many years of professional training. To address these bottlenecks, we propose an automatic RF filter circuit design tool using neural simulator and reinforcement learning. First we train a neural simulator to replace the PDE electromagnetic simulator. The neural-network-based simulator reduces each of the simulation time from 4 minutes on average to less than 100 millisecond while maintaining a high precision. Such dramatic acceleration enable us to leverage deep reinforcement learning algorithm and train an amortized inference policy to perform automatic design optimization in the imagined space from the neural simulator. The result automatic circuit-design agent achieves super-human design results and exceeds specifications in several cases. The automatic circuit-design agent also reduces the on-average design cycle from days to under a few seconds. Even more surprisingly, we demonstrate that the neural simulator can generalize to design spaces far from the training dataset and in a sense it has learned the underlying physics--Maxwell equations. We also demonstrate that the reinforcement learning has discovered many expert-like design intuitions. This work marks a step in using neural simulators and reinforcement learning in RF circuit design and the proposed method is generally applicable to many other design problems and domains in close affinity.", "tldr": "Automatic radio-frequency filter circuit design using neural simulator and reinforcement learning.", "keywords": ["Electronic Design Automation", "Neural Networks", "Deep Reinforcement Learning", "Neural Simulator"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/bffcffed569f85b1a16ca54b2fd52b79be27eb4b.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work demonstrates a neural network (CNN) trained on a large amount of labeled data to predict S-parameters.

The system performs parametric optimization within this predefined structure rather than generating designs with true geometric or topological novelty. This template-based approach severely restricts its applicability, as it cannot address the vast space of arbitrary, multi-layer layouts common in real-world RF and PCB design, which graph-based methods are better suited to handle.\n\n**Unproven Scalability:** The agent's success is demonstrated within a low-dimensional design space (one discrete and nine continuous parameters). The framework's viability for more complex problems remains questionable, as the performance of reinforcement learning agents often degrades significantly in high-dimensional continuous action spaces due to the curse of dimensionality, making exploration and credit assignment exponentially more difficult.\n\n**Limited Algorithmic Novelty in AI:** From a machine learning perspective, the paper's contribution is more an application of existing methods than a development of new ones. The framework integrates a standard CNN architecture with a well-established continuous-control RL algorithm (TQC) to solve a problem that is structurally equivalent to a contextual bandit. While the integration is effective, the core AI components do not, in themselves, represent a fundamental advance in the field of machine learning.\n\n**Insufficient Justification for Methodological Choices:** The paper lacks a rigorous ablation study to justify its choice of a complex reinforcement learning algorithm. Given that the problem is formulated as a single-step decision task (a contextual bandit), the necessity of a sequential RL framework like TQC/SAC is not self-evident. A thorough evaluation would have compared the chosen method against other powerful, non-sequential optimization techniques, such as evolutionary algorithms (e.g., GA) or Bayesian Optimization."}, "questions": {"value": "I have the following questions: \n\n1.
