While current benchmarks test knowledge recall and reasoning, few evaluate whether models can extract patterns from noisy experimental datasets. Using simulated condensed matter data, we prompt models to identify structures from 2D intensity arrays in the face of noise and limited instrumental resolution, scoring them such that a score of 1 indicates complete accuracy, while 0.5 denotes deviation by an extent equivalent to typical experimental error. We test recent reasoning models. The best models score only 0.13 out of 1 averaged across all questions, rising to 0.20 for questions without noise. This pales in comparison to human–written code, which score 0.37 (averaged) and 0.55 (noiseless). Clear failure modes were identified: models can find simple features, but struggle to trace continuous patterns or compute derived quantities. Performance predictably degrades with increased data resolution and noise levels. These results show current frontier models cannot reliably perform scientific data analysis, highlighting a significant gap between current capabilities and practical uses in reinforcement learning–based agents for scientific discovery.", "tldr": "The ability of frontier agentic models to perform scientific data analysis at a professional standard were evaluated", "keywords": ["Science", "Physics", "Evaluation", "Large Language Models", "Benchmark", "Agent"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/99bc4eca189e596e745a784269b8281d355cc0af.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/79920b6f801bc80547b6f0c3877b1f4ca715ec76.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces a new benchmark, called SciPro Arena, to evaluate language models on real-world scientific analysis tasks. Given a stream of numerical data (e.g., a 2D intensity map with real energy and momentum axes) and some question, models extract patterns from examples and provide numerical answers which are scored by deviation from ground truth obtained from a realistic simulator. The authors evaluated 14 recent reasoning models both open- and closed-source on 135 questions (27 question types, each tested at 5 noise level times). Recent models tend to perform better (e.g., o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro), but they only reach <15% on average while a human baseline program (~400 Python lines) scores 37%. Even when removing the noise, SOTA models score 20% while human program gets 55%.

Specifically, what is the impact of the tokenization process on numerical values provided in the context. There's been some work in the literature on shedding light on typical error patterns of models on tasks involving numerical reasoning (e.g., https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11781).\n\n- For each question, three in-context examples are included as part of the prompt. According to the paragraph Form of questions in Section 3.2, each example contains a matrix of numbers with whitespace delimiters. While it provides some structured to the prompt, it is unclear to me what is the impact of presenting the information that way. To me in a realistic scenario the data would be ingested as a CSV file or some other structured format instead of free form text strings.\n\n- The title of the paper contains \"AI agent capabilities\" but without tools or scaffolding that enable LLMs to interact with some environment, I wouldn't call the models being tested AI agents. Also, to be more realistic and comparable with the human baseline, I would argue the models should have been able to use tools, e.g. generating code, to deal with numerical values.\n\n### Minor\nLine 146 mentions that ARPES analysis is an inverse problem, but line 151 says \"the aim of ARPES data analysis is then to work out x→ y\".

ARPES has numerous complexities and specialities in, making it particularly difficult. If the authors goals are to more generally evaluate analysis of scientific data, they would perhaps do better first by characterizing different types/dimensions of scientific data, collecting samples of each, and doing a more systematic evaluation. In other words, the generalization from ARPES to all scientific data seems somewhat of a leap here.\n - Related to this, I'd really like to learn not how the models performs overall on this benchmark, but how the models perform on different aspects of scientific data analysis. Is it possible to identify different types of scientific reasoning required for this task? In other words, rather than (or as well as) having 27 domain-specific question types, identify N data analysis types (e.g., interpolation, prediction, pattern recognition, noise tolerance, data cleaning, visual interpretation, etc.). I'd love to see the paper's framing and conclusions mapped from the physics domain to the AI research domain more.\n - Frontier models appear to be applied in a vanilla/naive way, i.e., do a single-call direct query to the model. However, there are numerous \"AI Scientist\" systems out there that do coding, iterative reasoning, reflect loops (e.g., AIScientist, CodeScientist, ReAct, Reflexion, CodeAct) that might do better at this task. This should be clarified, in particular the conclusions may only apply to \"direct query\" uses of frontier models.\n - The results seem somewhat dependent on the prompting strategy used, e.g., choices of few-shot prompting\n - For several of the plots, I'm not sure what to take away from them - highlighting the takeaway in the caption, rather than just summarizing the visual data (e.g., \"accuracy decrease with noise\") would be very helpful."}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "bPzlK3r6g6", "forum": "ZU9O206WAr", "replyto": "ZU9O206WAr", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8271/Reviewer_J31F"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8271/Reviewer_J31F"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission8271/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761938875954, "cdate": 1761938875954, "tmdate": 1762920207416, "mdate": 1762920207416, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a new benchmark called SciProArena that measures how good recent LLMs are for the task of scientific data analysis.
