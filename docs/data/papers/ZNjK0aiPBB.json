In this work, we present a novel framework, based on causal transformers, for collaborative learning of heterogeneous ITE estimators across disparate data sources. Our approach can be deployed across distributed institutions (such as hospitals) via Federated Learning, enabling training on a large and diverse dataset (without sharing sensitive health data), and the same framework can be applied locally when multiple heterogeneous data sources exist within a single institution, breaking down data silos. The proposed method is flexible to handle diverse patient populations and non-identical patient measurements (covariates) across different data sources, while allowing for the estimation of treatment effects of disparate treatments being administered across these sources. Moreover, this framework can be utilized to predict the effects of novel and unseen treatments by utilizing available treatment level information. Thorough experimental evaluation on real-world clinical trial and widely-used research datasets demonstrates that our method surpasses existing baselines. Furthermore, analysis of our model's attention mechanisms reveals clinically meaningful disease and treatment-related patterns validated by domain expertise, demonstrating the interpretability and clinical relevance of our approach.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Heterogeneous Treatments Effect Estimation", "Federated Learning", "Healthcare"], "primary_area": "other topics in machine learning (i.e., none of the above)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/0a52cc7bd13ff35401f3f5cd8387b987dc574103.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "In this paper, authors have proposed a novel framework for individualised treatment effects (ITE) estimation under a new and complex setting where there is heterogeneity in covariates, treatments, and outcome spaces. Specifically, they accommodate heterogeneity even in treatment spaces where different hospitals/sites might be using different treatments in addition to having different covariates. This problem is solved in federated learning settings. Under this complex setting, they employ a transformer as the key model for processing heterogeneous features and treatments whose parameters are learnt through sharing parameters across client sites while having site-specific prediction layers. It is interesting to note the way they combined heterogeneous features and treatments from different sites, which also enables the framework to be utilised in a zero-shot learning for evaluating new treatments. Additionally, they evaluated the proposed method across well-established benchmarks as well as real-world RCT trial datasets, all of which show the effectiveness of the method. It is also noted that the attention mechanism highlights some important features for accurate predictions as well as corresponding to different treatments, which have been confirmed by the clinicians for their validity and hence showing the importance of the proposed method."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1. The authors have discussed a **novel problem setting**, as evidenced by Table 4, for ITE estimation considering heterogeneity in covariates, treatments and outcome subspaces. Specifically, this consider a setting where different sites not only have different covariates but also may have different treatments given to the subjects, which make it different from the existing work. So, this is ITE estimation in a federated learning setting. I think authors haven't sufficiently stressed this novel aspect of their work. Maybe they should first stress novelty on the problem setting and then on the framework.\n\n2. The other interesting novelty comes from developing a **novel framework**, powered by the transformer architecture, to solve the complex problem settings. I think this is very unique and challenging, the way they handled heterogeneity in covariates and treatments at different federated learning clients. This is because for sharing model parameters, the model should be the same, and it is only this clever approach which made it happen otherwise with heterogeneity, one won't be able to do that (however, alas! this idea is let down due to lack of clarity - discussed below).\n\n3. The authors also claimed that the proposed framework can work in a zero-shot setting. This would enable evaluation of new treatments, which is a very important feature of the model for the field.\n\n4. Since the framework is attention based so it also enables interpretability of results. Authors have claimed that the attention finds clinically relevant features wrt outcomes as well as treatments which were validated by the clinicians. \n\n5. There is sufficient validation across existing benchmarks as well as real world RCT dataset."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "My **major concern is clarity** of this paper, as discussed below. All the key ideas of the paper look magical without explanations.\n\n1. The central point of the paper is that the paper discusses a novel problem setting and then proposes a novel framework to handle this complex and practical problem setting. Moreover, specifically, in a federated learning setting, each client may have different covariates, treatments and outcomes. Now, to share model parameters under a federated learning setting, the model should have the same architecture. However, the authors did not provide sufficient explanations about how input data is processed that despite having different covariates and treatments, the model architecture remains the same with the same input processing. So, the key novelty is let down by a lack of clear descriptions about input processing. This was the key part of the paper, so a visual presentation should have been given for the framework.\n\n2. Authors claim that the proposed model can be used in zero-shot setting for predicting outcomes under new interventions but there isn't sufficient discussion on how this would be enabled; rather, they refer the reader to experiments. They must explain, at least intuition, how this will be enabled. This way, another key idea of the paper is let down by a lack of explanations.\n\n3. The proposed model looks to add a massive computational workload as compared to baselines, which is never discussed/acknowledged in the paper. This is also reflected in its need for GPU-based machines for running experiments. \n\nThe way inputs are processed, it looks like it is adding a lot of computations because it processes names of the features in addtion to their values, requiring NLP processing. Secondly, for each feature, multiple tokens are created, each of which has dimensions of 256. So, a proper discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of their input processing should be covered. There should be an analysis of the value added by this approach against the overhead added.\n\n4. FL literature has developed several new methods since the first work. Why the most recent approaches are not discussed and used for weight aggregation? Also, there is no discussion about the baselines for the local setting and how they were selected. Since the paper claims to propose new problem setting so we don't expect much baselines for the federated setting but for local setting they have missed some important baselines, e.g., there are some work based on transformers - why are they not included? Similarly, there was a method from van der Schaar lab (I guess, it is cited in the paper) to deal with heterogeneous covariates -- why is that not compared in the local setting, rather you compared simple homogeneous setting there? I think a massive model will most likely win over simple baselines as used in the paper. Did you discuss their parameters anywhere in the paper?\n\n5. There is no explanation for using an alternate optimisation approach at client sites. Many key ideas are left for the reader to guess.\n\nThis way, the key ideas are overshadowed by a lack of clarity.

One of the claims of the paper is that the framework can model different outcomes in each site, but that is not proven either theoretically or with experimental evaluation.\n\n- The metrics applied to real-world experiment do not provide enough insights about causal inference. First, RMSE-F is a regression metric that do not reflect causal effects. Second, the original data is randomized, therefore potential outcome estimation is not needed to estimate the average treatment effect. Comparing the methods with observational ATT only reflects biases in the factual regression, no counterfactual regression.\n\n- When sites have disjoint covariates and disjoint treatments, there is no clear mechanism that forces alignment of confounders or treatment semantics across sites; at that point the method behaves more like multitask federated representation learning than true cross-site causal transport.\n\n- The zero-shot causal effect estimation is over-stated with the current experiments. First, metrics given are only factual, so causal effects have not been validated. Second, the table is not informative enough: if the treatment is not informative about the outcome, then the absence of the treatment would not affect drastically to the outcome prediction. The table should compare the performance of the model without federated learning, to see if the 'zero-shot' strategy helps.\n\n- While the evaluation in Table 2 include different sites that have different distribution of the treatment (`line 273`), the methods use for comparison, FedCI and iFedTree are not prepared for that setting.

Leveraging extra information about labels and sharing encoders across sites may help to the prediction of causal effects. However, the results over real-world data are not conclusive enough for me to recommend the acceptance of the paper. There are some claims that are over-stated and not proven either theoretically or experimentally, as the zero-shot capabilities, the hability of handling with different outcomes in each site, or causal identifiability. In addition, I have accumulated many questions (below) that should be addressed. Although by themselves those questions would not make me to recommend a rejection, the sheer number of them tips the balance towards rejection. I would be happy to raise my score if all questions and more experiments are added, and claims are re-stated in order to adjust the experimental evaluation.\n\n> References \n\n[1] Vo, T.

Some of them are oriented to improve readability.\n\n- Could you provide a formal definition of what a _disparate data source_ (or _disparate systems_ in `line 50`) is? It is not clear what do the authors mean by that term, although I can infer its meaning from the rest of the text.\n\n- I have not found any reproducibility statement in the paper. Are the authors planning to sumbit the code to any public repository, or share it somehow? It would help to increase the adoption of its contribution.\n\n- In causal inference, the term _intervention_ usually refers to the _act of intervening_. That is, the action of changing the value of the treatment variable, to evaluate the changes in the outcome. Therefore, I suggest the authors to change the name of 'intervention' by 'treatment' when refering to the random variable (e.g. `line 106`), and keep 'intervention' when refering to _the act of intervening_.\n\n- In ´line 128` the definition of the potential outcome fucntion as the conditional expectation is a decision taken assuming zero-mean additive noise, which could not be the case. I just wanted to be sure that authors understand this particularity.\n\n- _Stochasticity_ assumed in `line 133` is usually refered as _positivity_ and I think that are not exactly the same. Specially, _stochasticity_ is only the same as _positivity_ if the conditional distribution of the treatment has density in all the range. That is, a distribution $P(T|X)$ can be stochastic and, still, has zero density in some points, which may violate positivity. \n\n- The notation in `lines 138-144`should be revised. Authors should differentiate between measurable spaces and random variables. When refering to disparate interventions ($T^l\\neq T^m$), does that mean that the support is different? Or does it mean that the random variable is different? If only the support changes, maybe $Supp(T^m) \\neq Supp(T^l)$ is clearer.Some light should be given. The same happens with the accessible variables: $d^m$ is only a natural number. Therefore, when we have different $d$, do the models share $\\min (d^m, d^l)$? Is not clear _in the notation_ if the random variables $X^l, X^m$ can be different. \n\n- Do the IHDP datasets used in section 4 belong to the setting A or the setting B in (Hill, 2011)?\n\n- Is it necessary to mantain an acronym in the title? some readers may not be familiar with the term.\n\n- Tables are reportred with _averaged_ results. However, I did not find what the intervals mean, and more importantly, what bold numbers mean. Usually, bold means statistical difference. However, no significance test has been reported.\n\n- Table 1 is somehow strange. The centralized version of FedTransTEE achieves much lower errors compared to other baselines, especially in ATE metric. Is there any justification for that? An ATE error of 3.8, 3.9, etc., of baselines in IHDP, knowing that the true ATE is 4, seems to bee too high (Hill, 2011)[1].\n\n- In appendix, `line 745`states that 'sites are exhangeable'. Can you go deeper on that assumption? How can be sites exchangeables if ditributions are heterogeneous?\n\n- When there are no shared treatment and covariates, what reasons do we have to think that the joint training improves the ITE estimation? \n\n- Can authors formalize when sharing the encoders help ITE estimation, rather than risking negative transfer?\n\n\n\n> References\n\n[1]Hill, J.
