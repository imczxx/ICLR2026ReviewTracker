This capacity is necessary, for instance, to distinguish an image containing a red square and a blue circle from an image containing a blue square and a red circle. Recent work has found that language models solve this ‘binding problem’ via a set of symbol-like, content-independent indices, but it is unclear whether similar mechanisms are employed by Vision Language Models (VLM). This question is especially relevant, given the persistent failures of VLMs on tasks that require binding. Here, we identify a previously unknown set of emergent symbolic mechanisms that support binding specifically in VLMs, via a content-independent, spatial indexing scheme. Moreover, we find that binding errors, when they occur, can be traced directly to failures in these mechanisms. Taken together, these results shed light on the mechanisms that support symbol-like processing in VLMs, and suggest possible avenues for reducing the number of binding failures exhibited by these models.", "tldr": "We describe a set of symbolic-like mechanisms that VLMs use to bind to visual entities in context", "keywords": ["visual object binding", "vision-langue model", "symbolic reasoning", "interpretability"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6f6754082b18b68a14ec93637f91be2a916f4357.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper investigates emergent symbolic mechanisms for binding features and objects in vision language models.

Using a scene description task where models must describe remaining objects in multi-object images, the authors employ a thorough suite of methodologies in order to uncover the underlying mechanisms across a range of VLM architectures: PCA, representational similarity analysis (RSA), causal mediation analysis (CMA), and targeted interventions. The core finding is a three-stage binding process: 1) Position ID heads compute spatial indices for objects mentioned in the prompt; 2) ID selection heads select the position ID for the target object; and 3) Feature retrieval heads use the selected position ID to access target object features. The authors then perform a series of analyses to characterize the binding mechanisms in greater detail. They find that models tend to use relative vs. absolute position IDS; that the binding mechanisms generalize to more realistic images; that position IDs are localized to image patches containing the relevant object; and that the same position IDs are used in more complex relational reasoning tasks. They finally perform an error analysis, demonstrating that binding errors correlate with failures in position ID processing. \n\n\nThe authors then demonstrate that binding errors correlate with failures in position ID processing, particularly in low-entropy conditions where objects share features."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1. **Importance of the research question**.
