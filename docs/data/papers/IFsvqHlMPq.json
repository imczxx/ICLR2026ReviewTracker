Most existing approaches, however, model these tasks as separate mappings, limiting their flexibility and robustness. We propose a multimodal representation learning framework that unifies diverse polymer informatics tasks within a single model. Our approach treats each property or structural element as an individual submodality and introduces an information-theoretic objective that balances informativeness across arbitrary subsets of modalities. The resulting Multimodal Masked Polymer Autoencoder (MMPAE) serves as an end-to-end foundation model, supporting both\ncross-modal generation and retrieval. Extensive experiments on large polymer datasets show that MMPAE not only surpasses strong task-specific baselines under realistic missing-value conditions, but also provides a flexible platform for diverse downstream applications within a unified architecture.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Polymer Informatics", "Multimodal Learning", "Scientific discovery", "Data-driven polymer development", "Multi-view representation learning"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/bd519a0d794f601350674cda0f0d3a13ac1ea408.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a multimodal representation framework that treats polymer structures and numerical properties within the shared latent space.\nIn particular, each attribute is treated as an individual submodality, while hierarchical mixture-of-experts reweighting and the InfoNCE alignment are further incorporated to improve performance.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves strong performance across various tasks."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 1}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

The claimed “multimodal” setup is very unconvincing. \n    * MMPAE only uses polymer structures and numerical properties as input, closer to multi‑view learning than multimodality. \n    * The multimodal methods mentioned in the paper integrate complementary sources of information, such as 2D graphs and 3D geometries, which differ fundamentally from the setup in this work. Therefore, referencing these studies to justify MMPAE is inappropriate.\n\n2. The experimental section is very problematic.\n    * For the dataset used in this work, polymers within this dataset are generated by enumeratively combining chemical fragments extracted from synthesized polymers, and their properties are predicted by PolyBERT [1] rather than experimental measurements or high‑fidelity simulations. Such a dataset may be suitable for pretraining purposes (as in PolyBERT itself), but should not be used for benchmarking or evaluating model performance, as it cannot provide reliable or meaningful validation of the proposed method.\n    * For the baselines used in this work, it's necessary to include more recent and competitive methods, such as MMPolymer [2], Uni-Poly [3], PolyNC [4], and MCP [5]. The current baselines (e.g., Transpolymer and PolyBERT) are outdated, making the comparisons unconvincing and the claimed performance improvements questionable.\n    * For the settings used in this work, randomly masking the input is quite questionable and scientifically unsound. For example, when PSMILES tokens are randomly masked, the ground‑truth property of the original polymer may no longer hold, as the modified polymer no longer corresponds to the same chemical structure. In this case, the experimental results lose their validity and persuasiveness.\n    * In addition, it is necessary to provide the original numerical experimental results rather than only presenting visualized figures, as the latter cannot fully support quantitative.\n\n[1] Kuenneth C, Ramprasad R. polyBERT: a chemical language model to enable fully machine-driven ultrafast polymer informatics[J].

I am throwing out a question here: the submodality defined in this paper corresponds to the polymor patch or each property. It is like tokens in the transformer models; it is a sequential data format that represents their modality altogether. In my opinion, this cannot be claimed as a multimodal model, as it does not handle two types of input for the same entity; there is no explicit fusion or alignment design for modalities.\n2. For the model structure, it uses a typical auto-encoder transformer model, and uses the CLS token for the two downstream tasks. The novelty may only be slight changes to the loss design based on the MI, which are not significant enough.\n3. In the Figure 2 training approach, the upper CLS is from unmasked embeddings from both X and Y, the lower CLS is from masked ones (after encoding by the transformer). The contrastive learning is conducted between these two CLS tokens, which will lead the model to learn an objective -- how to predict CLS better with less information. In this way, the more input missing, the larger the margin should appear between MMPAE and baselines; however, we did not see this pattern in the results, Figures 3 and 4. \n4. There are no ablation experiments in this paper, which can not prove the methods and novelties proposed in Section 3. \n5. The writing of this paper can be improved.
