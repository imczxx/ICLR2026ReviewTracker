This remains a challenging problem, as existing approaches based on variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks often rely on multiple loss terms, complicating the optimization process. Furthermore, sequential disentanglement methods face challenges when applied to real-world data, and there is currently no established evaluation protocol for assessing their performance in such settings. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative models, but no theoretical formalization exists for their application to sequential disentanglement. In this work, we introduce the Diffusion Sequential Disentanglement Autoencoder (DiffSDA), a novel, modal-agnostic framework effective across diverse real-world data modalities, including time series, video, and audio. DiffSDA leverages a new probabilistic modeling, latent diffusion, and efficient samplers, while incorporating a challenging evaluation protocol for rigorous testing. Our experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DiffSDA outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in sequential disentanglement.", "tldr": "DiffSDA is a new diffusion-based, modality-agnostic framework that outperforms prior methods in unsupervised sequential disentanglement across real-world data like time series, video, and audio.", "keywords": ["Sequential Disentanglement", "Diffusion Models", "Unsupervised Learning"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c36cfc97fd4fe500650188c04770b3c400c2c4a3.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This work presents a new systematic approach to latent factor disentanglement of sequential data. It is based on a combination of several models 1) to extract static and dynamic components of latent factors, 2) to stochastically encode sequential data, 3) to conditionally decode sequential data based on latent factors. Additional components to deal with high-dimensional data (such as video) might be required as well, such as VQ-VAE.\n\nThe proposed method is described using the language of probabilities, akin to what we are used to when dealing with diffusion models.\n\nThe authors perform a thorough and extensive validation campaign, using an appropriate experimental protocol.

Text-to-image generation indeed requires pairs of image and prompts, but unconditional models have flourished before those work, and they do not require labels. In general, I find the problem of learning disentangled representation sufficiently recognized as an important issue to address in the community, that does not need additional motivations.\n\n* I am a bit worried about the claim of \"simplicity\" of the proposed approach. I view the proposed method as a complex system, involving several models (some of which pretrained, others that require separate training) combined in a coherent design, which is far from being simple. Also, the lack of apparent hyper-parameters (a critic the authors advance for other methods on disentanglement from the state of the art), is in my humble opinion, another illustration of downplaying the complications of the proposed system. In practice, diffusion models are not so easy to train, as demonstrated by the choice of the authors to rely on an enormous amount of work that has been done to come up with \"recipies\" to elucidate the design space of diffusion models."}, "questions": {"value": "* From the introduction, the requirement for \"labeled\" data stems from, e.g., text-to-image generation. Original work from Ho et al., and from Song et al., are unconditional models which do not require labeled data.\n\n* Check your claims: when the authors say they propose a novel probabilistic approach, they are actually using standard practice in diffusion modeling. The main difference is that they combine two diffusion processes, one for learning (and generating) disentangled latents for static and dynamic components, and one for learning (and generating) the sequential data distribution, conditioned on the disentangled latents. Both models are learned concurrently using a single loss. While my remark does not want to diminish the technical contribution of the proposed method, I think that the claim for novelty is too strong.\n\n* As stated in lines 212-213, eq. (3) does not require training for the latents $(s_0, d_0^{1:V})$ generative model, thus this optimization is separate. Then, the loss in eq. (3) is not the only loss you consider in your overall training of DiffSDA, right? Then, I would like to ask the authors to clarify why in lines 221-222 they claim that only a single loss term is required.\n\n* In line 227, the last hidden representation $h^V$ is fed to a linear layer to produce $s_0$, but this is not reflected in Figure 1. This is just nitpicking, but for clarity, the figure could be easily amended to be coherent with the textual description of the architecture.\n\n* In lines 265-269, the authors mention that for high-dimensional data such as video, they abuse the notation (for ease of reading), and use symbols that denote ambient space, to indicate vector-quantized latent variables. This is clear. The question is: when considering other modalities, such as audio or general timeseries, there is no need for the VQ-VAE embeddings right?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 6}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "GfyVmstew9", "forum": "tooDJHBSvO", "replyto": "tooDJHBSvO", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16769/Reviewer_nupF"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16769/Reviewer_nupF"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission16769/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761056514796, "cdate": 1761056514796, "tmdate": 1762926813114, "mdate": 1762926813114, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes DiffSDA, a novel framework for unsupervised sequential disentanglement that leverages diffusion models to separate static and dynamic factors of variation across diverse modalities such as video, audio, and time-series data.\nThe key claimed contributions are:A novel, modal-agnostic probabilistic framework for sequential disentanglement based on diffusion processes, which models static and dynamic factors as interdependent.An efficient design that achieves disentanglement using a single, unified score estimation loss, simplifying optimization compared to methods requiring multiple loss terms.Demonstrated effectiveness on high-dimensional, real-world data, with capabilities for zero-shot disentanglement and further factorization into multiple interpretable factors via post-hoc PCA.The introduction of a new evaluation protocol for video-based disentanglement, including high-resolution datasets and unsupervised metrics (AED, AKD)."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 3}, "strengths": {"value": "1.
