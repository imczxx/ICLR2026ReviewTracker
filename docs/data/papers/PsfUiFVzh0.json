However, vision-language models (VLMs) still lack accurate understanding of the details and struggle to extract fine-grained structural information from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also hinder their capability to compare multiple charts and reason about their difference. In this paper, we develop a novel \"**ChartA**lign **B**enchmark (*ChartAB*)\" to provide a full-spectrum evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting tabular data, allocating visualization elements, and recognizing various attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We develop a JSON template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically designed for each grounding task. By applying a novel two-stage inference workflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability of aligning and comparing elements/attributes in two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on several recent VLMs sheds novel insights on their perception biases, weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding.", "tldr": "A benchmark and evaluation framework for vision–language models on fine-grained chart grounding and multi-chart alignment with augmented downstream QA reasoning.", "keywords": ["benchmarking", "chart understanding", "VLMs", "multi chart alignment", "fine grained visual grounding"], "primary_area": "datasets and benchmarks", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/8a4742914e2daebbe799a7283d99ce5b81a57121.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces the ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB), a benchmark designed to evaluate the fine-grained perceptual abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in chart understanding. The authors argue that existing benchmarks focus on simple QA, failing to assess detailed comprehension. ChartAB addresses this gap by proposing two core tasks: (1) chart grounding, which requires VLMs to extract structured information, such as tabular data and visual attributes (e.g., color, text style, legend position), into a JSON template, and (2) dense alignment, which uses a two-stage inference workflow to test a model's ability to compare and identify subtle differences between two similar charts. By evaluating several recent VLMs, the authors reveal significant weaknesses, biases, and hallucinations in current models' abilities to perceive complex chart structures, demonstrating that these foundational skills are critical for robust downstream reasoning."}, "soundness": {"value": 3}, "presentation": {"value": 3}, "contribution": {"value": 1}, "strengths": {"value": "The authors have conducted abundant experiments."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "- The paper's core terms, \"grounding\" and \"alignment,\" are used in a non-standard and confusing way. In V&L, \"grounding\" typically implies localizing language to specific spatial regions (e.g., bounding boxes). This paper redefines it as extracting information into a structured textual (JSON/CSV) format. This is more accurately described as data extraction or structured representation. Similarly, the term “alignment” usually refers to mapping representations between modalities (e.g., vision and language), or making models conform to certain preferences. The paper uses it to mean a simple comparison between two already extracted textual representations to find differences. This terminological choice overstates the novelty and creates confusion.\n\n- The practical utility of the \"Attribute Grounding & Alignment\" task is not well-motivated. The paper claims comparing attributes is an \"essential skill\", but it's unclear why a user would need a VLM to identify that one chart uses a \"bold\" font and another uses a \"normal\" font, or that one legend is on the left and another is on the right. The other two tasks also do not seem very practical but slightly more useful than \"Attribute Grounding & Alignment\".\n\n- ChartAB builds heavily on the existing ChartX dataset, with perturbations applied to create pairs. While this adds pairs for comparison, it doesn't sufficiently differentiate from prior chart benchmarks (e.g., ChartQA, CharXiv, MultiChartQA), which already cover QA, multi-hop reasoning, and multi-chart tasks. The focus on \"dense\" extraction feels incremental rather than groundbreaking, especially since similar grounding approaches (e.g., DePlot for image-to-CSV) are cited but not substantially advanced.\n\n\n- While the paper identifies VLM weaknesses like hallucinations, biases, and perceptual inaccuracies, it stops at analysis without proposing concrete enhancements (e.g., fine-tuning strategies or architectural changes). This makes the benchmark feel more diagnostic than constructive, limiting its impact on advancing VLMs for chart tasks."}, "questions": {"value": "What is the practical, real-world scenario for the \"Attribute Alignment\" task?"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "K1jnTwk6KR", "forum": "PsfUiFVzh0", "replyto": "PsfUiFVzh0", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9606/Reviewer_Xkh1"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9606/Reviewer_Xkh1"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9606/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761021810691, "cdate": 1761021810691, "tmdate": 1762921147712, "mdate": 1762921147712, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}}, "id": "uDkHqGtSaL", "forum": "PsfUiFVzh0", "replyto": "PsfUiFVzh0", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9606/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9606/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763110841485, "cdate": 1763110841485, "tmdate": 1763110841485, "mdate": 1763110841485, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes ChartAlignBench, a benchmark on chart dense grounding and alignment.

I don't agree with the authors that \"real-world use cases often require comparing similar charts to detect subtle differences among the charts\". While it might be true that sometimes one needs to compare a series of visualizations to check differences in data, I cannot imagine tasks such as comparing colors of chart elements or fonts of text being at all common, but these questions take up a significant portion of the benchmark.\n- The models evaluated are quite old. The best model, GPT-4o, is more than one year old at this point. No reasoning models are evaluated. Reasoning models have made tremendous progress in chart grounding, so I suspect the numbers will be a lot higher.\n- Most questions assess some form of perception, and a lot of it is meaningless or unanswerable. For things like identifying the font weight, you simply cannot do this. If you fix the font weight and make the whole chart image bigger, the text is going to be bigger. Overall I just don't find tasks like \"comparing the hex color of chart elements\" to be an interesting exercise.\n-The visualizations showing model performance are pretty difficult to parse. Presenting them in a table format would be better.\n- Given that the tasks cover a pretty fixed set of visualization design space (e.g., color, legend placement, fonts), I would expect finetuning to be really helpful, which the authors did not perform."}, "questions": {"value": "- How does the two-stage pipeline work for non-data-alignment questions?\n- What does Figure 9a mean?

Importantly:\n\n1. Being a benchmark, it is crucial to report the exact performance measurements of the baselines tested. Without them, the current choice of charts through Section 4 feels unclear and inappropriate. For example, on Figure 5, why do we only see a radar chart with nearly overlapping results exclusively for the one cell configuration (whereas the benchmark included two and three cells)? A well organized table is crucial for communicating exactly how far the current set of tested models go on the benchmark's task(s), along with a clear definition of the performance measure(s) close to the table. This feedback is applicable throughout Section 4.\n\n2. Lines 222-223 refer to Appendix A.7.2 implying that the 2-stage pipeline is unequivocally better, but on Table 1 the 1-stage multi-chart configuration is superior on 3 out of 9 chart types (3D Bar, Radar, and Box). Table 1 should be better organized (see #1 above---specifically, performance definition should be clearly linked, and whether higher/lower is better) and these mixed results should be more transparently discussed.\n\n3. VisText [1] and InsightBench [2] should be cited, as much of the value from drawing relationships between charts is to be able to draw insights and understand trends, which are the topic of these other data resources.\n\n4.
