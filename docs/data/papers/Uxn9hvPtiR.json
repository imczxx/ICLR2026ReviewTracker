In oceanography, high-resolution\ncurrent data are critical for coastal management, environmental monitoring, and\nmaritime safety. However, available satellite products, such as Copernicus data\nfor sea water velocity at ∼0.08° spatial resolution and global ocean models, often\nlack the spatial granularity required for detailed local analyses. In this work, we\n(a) introduce a supervised deep learning framework based on neural operators\nfor solving PDEs and providing arbitrary resolution solutions, and (b) propose\ndownscaling models with an application to Copernicus ocean current data. Additionally, our method can model surrogate PDEs and predict solutions at arbitrary\nresolution, regardless of the input resolution.

Proposed methods are solely combination of different techniques without strong insights and intuition.\n- The related work section covers only a small portion of existing studies on super-resolution and downscaling for PDEs. Many important works are missing, especially diffusion-based approaches [1, 2]. Please also refer to [3]. Although [3] primarily focuses on climate applications, as discussed below, the proposed method should also be evaluated on climate data.\n- The contributions and advantages of the proposed work are not clearly stated. While the paper introduces a series of downscaling methods, the differences between these methods and existing approaches remain unclear. Moreover, the advantages of the proposed methods are not analyzed throughout the paper.\n- Although this work focuses on oceanographic applications, there appears to be no specific design tailored for oceanographic data. Such characteristics are not considered within the overall framework. Therefore, the authors should also evaluate their method on other related tasks, such as climate downscaling, to better demonstrate its practical applicability to real-world problems.\n- The reported experimental results are unsatisfactory. As shown in Table 1, the performance of both `Temp_DFNO` and `Temp_SpecDFNO` is consistently worse than that of DFNO-2 under the 32×32 setting.\n- The running time should also be reported as an additional metric for performance evaluation.\n- For both PDE solving and downscaling tasks, only two baselines (CNN and DFNO) are considered. The authors should include more baselines, such as traditional numerical methods, earlier CNN-based approaches, recent neural operator-based super-resolution methods, and generative model-based approaches such as [1, 2]. Although some of these methods may depend on input resolution, the authors should still report comparative results to demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve competitive performance.\n\n[1] Srivastava, Prakhar, et al. \"Precipitation downscaling with spatiotemporal video diffusion.\" _Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems_ 37 (2024): 56374-56400.\n[2] Mardani, Morteza, et al. \"Residual corrective diffusion modeling for km-scale atmospheric downscaling.\" _Communications Earth & Environment_ 6.1 (2025): 124.\n[3] Rampal, Neelesh, et al. \"Enhancing regional climate downscaling through advances in machine learning.\" _Artificial Intelligence for the Earth Systems_ 3.2 (2024): 230066."}, "questions": {"value": "- Are `DUNO`, `SpecDFNO`, `SpecDFNODiff`, and `MetaGradDFNO` the methods proposed by the authors?
