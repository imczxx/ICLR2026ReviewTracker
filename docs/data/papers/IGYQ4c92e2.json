Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on simple questions or web-only queries, DRBench evaluates agents on multi-step queries (for example, \"What changes should we make to our product roadmap to ensure compliance with this standard?\") that require identifying supporting facts from both the public web and private company knowledge base. Each task is grounded in realistic user personas and enterprise context, spanning a heterogeneous search space that includes productivity software, cloud file systems, emails, chat conversations, and the open web. Tasks are generated through a carefully designed synthesis pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification, and agents are evaluated on their ability to recall relevant insights, maintain factual accuracy, and produce coherent, well-structured reports. We release 15 deep research tasks across 10 domains, such as Sales, Cybersecurity, and Compliance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DRBench by evaluating diverse DR agents across open- and closed-source models (such as GPT, Llama, and Qwen) and DR strategies, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and the critical path for advancing enterprise deep research.", "tldr": "DRBench benchmarks AI agents on enterprise deep research with 15 persona-grounded tasks across diverse domains and 350 files.

A major limitation of the benchmark is its limited size. 15 tasks and 114 insights makes the benchmark significantly smaller which raises questions on statistical significance of the evaluation.\n2. Extraction of atomic insights from the final report is a very important step in the evaluation method since 3 of the 4 metrics depend on it. However due to the use of llms, this step will be noisy which will lead to less reliable metric scores.\n3. Having LLM-as-a-judge as the only method of evaluation raises question about the accuracy of evaluation since llms can halucinate and show biasness. Even though the authors talk about correlation with human preference, It does not really indicate how accurate the llm evaluations are.\n4. Synthetic data generation, even though it makes the benchmark generation approach more scalable, raises questions about the internal enterprise data being realistic in nature. Combined with the fact that LLM is also used for evaluation, it can lead to more noise and biasness in evaluation results.\n5. Even though the paper includes several ablation studies, it does not provide indepth analysis of why the results are the way they are.
