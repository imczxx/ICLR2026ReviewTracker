However, most existing research is limited to\nusing camera sensors and prior object information for affordance prediction. In\nthis study, we introduce a unified framework called Tactile Affordance in Robot\nSynesthesia (TARS) for dexterous manipulation that employs robotic synesthesia\nthrough a unified point cloud representation. This framework harnesses the visuotactile affordance of objects, effectively merging comprehensive visual perception\nfrom external cameras with tactile feedback from local optical tactile sensors to\nhandle tasks involving both contact and non-contact states. We simulated tactile\nperception in a virtual environment and trained task-oriented manipulation policies.\nSubsequently, we tested our approach on four distinct manipulation tasks, conducting extensive experiments to evaluate how different modules within our method\noptimize the performance of these manipulation policies.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["visuotactile affordance"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/022f726b38f065b2b707e5545750a132a4c20772.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper is a duplicate submission of an already-published work: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10766612.
