We aim to make the best of both worlds through model collaboration, where different models in the training pipeline collaborate and complement each other. Since LM responses feature interleaving skills that favor different models, we propose Switch Generation, where pretrained and aligned model versions take turns to ``speak'' in a response sequence. Specifically, we train a switcher LM by learning from outcomes of choosing different models to generate the next segment across diverse queries and contexts. At inference time, the switcher LM guides different model checkpoints to dynamically generate the next segment where their strengths are most needed. Extensive experiments with 8 model collaboration baselines and 18 datasets show that 1) model collaboration consistently outperforms individual models on 16 out of 18 tasks, and 2) Switch Generation further outperforms baselines by 12.9% on average. Further analysis reveals that Switch Generation discovers compositional skills to solve problems where individual models struggle and generalizes to unseen models and tasks, reusing and repurposing by-products in expensive model training pipelines that are otherwise discarded.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["model collaboration", "collaborative inference"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b1f041779b524306feb4cf4380d5550d266b4f85.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes to use a trained model selector to select from an aligned model and its pretrained version.

Pre-trained models do perform better on tasks such as WikiDYK and creativity. The idea of \"not discarding pre-trained models\" is quite meaningful given the high cost of training .\n\n2. **Innovative Method Design:** Segment-level switching offers a new granularity option; using LM as a switcher leverages its language understanding capabilities to address the timing of switching, a reasonable design; model-labeled traces help the switcher learn the strengths of each model; and rollout evaluates the average performance of each choice.\n\n3. **The experimental design is reasonable and comprehensive:** The 18 datasets are representative and cover different types (knowledge/reasoning/creativity/security); the 8 baselines cover different collaboration methods (API/text/logit/weight level); ablation experiments (patch size, training strategy) were conducted; the supplementary materials include statistical significance tests; and the generalization ability was also verified.\n\n4. **Experimental results are good:** Significant improvements were observed on most tasks, outperforming single models on tasks 16 and 18, with an average improvement of 12.9% compared to the baseline.\n\n5. **Strong generalization ability:** It can generalize to different model families (Qwen2.5), different numbers of models (2/4), specialized experts, and unseen tasks.\n\n6. **Clear Writing:** Figure 1 effectively illustrates the motivation (the pretrained model does indeed perform better on some tasks), and Figure 2 fully demonstrates the methodology.

Distillation reduces costs but only restores 57.5% of the gain. More importantly, the paper does not provide actual runtime and throughput comparisons, which are crucial for practical deployment. Hyperparameters are sensitive, and the patch size needs to be optimized for the specific task.\n\n2. **Weak theoretical foundation**\nWhy is segment-level analysis superior to token-level or response-level analysis? There is a lack of theoretical explanation; the ablation in Table 2 is insufficient.\nWhy is tracing helpful? The R² in Figure 5 is 0.017, which shows almost no correlation.\n- The definition of \"new skills\" (10.7%) in Table 5 is not rigorous enough and may be partly due to randomness.\nHow does the Switcher learn to recognize different skills? Figure 6 is only descriptive.\n- The lack of in-depth analysis of these issues limits further improvement of the methodology.\n\n3. **The difference between this method and routing methods is not significant enough.**\nThe essential difference lies mainly in the granularity and the use of traces; it is not a revolutionary breakthrough.\n\n4. **Soundness-related issues**\nTraining the Switcher requires 10k samples × 32 rollouts (320k calls); sample efficiency was not discussed.\n- Patch sizes vary greatly across different tasks (Table 2 shows 10-100), but there is no research on adaptive selection.\n- The rule that the beginning and end must use aligned models is hard-coded and not elegant enough.\n\n5. **Insufficient experimental analysis**\n- Table 1 in the main text does not indicate statistical significance (although the supplementary materials do).\n- Some datasets choose to be based on hypotheses rather than empirical evidence.\n- Different evaluation indicators are not uniform\n- On which tasks is switch generation inferior to single-model or baseline approaches? Why? These analyses are missing.\n\n6. **Security Issues**\nThe Ethics Statement mentions that a misaligned base model may circumvent safety guardrails, but it lacks empirical assessment of the risks associated with harmful content generation. This is a serious concern.\n\n7. **Generalization is still questionable.**\n- Table 3 shows a significant decrease in generalization performance (setting 1: 5.8% → setting 4: 3.1%).\nCan models with different architectures collaborate? For example, can GPT and LLaMA be combined ?\nHow did it perform with long text (>512 tokens)? Not evaluated.\n\n8. **Minor Writing Issues**\nThe definitions of pretrained/finetuned/aligned in footnote 1 appeared relatively late.
