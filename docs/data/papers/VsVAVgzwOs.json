We present a novel attack framework that leverages high-fidelity surrogate models to decode sensitive information from a target model’s context.\nImportantly, our attacks succeed even when the model behaves as intended and without exploiting explicit security vulnerabilities (\\eg, through jailbreaking).\nWe design two attack variants: (i) an \\emph{undetectable attack} that passively analyzes benign generations, and (ii) an \\emph{adaptive attack} that strategically selects queries to maximize information gain. Our findings show that optimized queries achieve up to 100\\% attack success rates across models and remain effective under instruction-based defenses.\nThis work highlights the urgent need for defenses capable of detecting and mitigating private information leakage during inference.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["security and privacy", "membership inference"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1921d708492b0825a57ffde1f851294892c17076.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"withdrawal_confirmation": {"value": "I have read and agree with the venue's withdrawal policy on behalf of myself and my co-authors."}}, "id": "mXYRg61pQW", "forum": "VsVAVgzwOs", "replyto": "VsVAVgzwOs", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7576/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission7576/-/Withdrawal"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1762511324790, "cdate": 1762511324790, "tmdate": 1762511324790, "mdate": 1762511324790, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Withdrawal", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": true}
