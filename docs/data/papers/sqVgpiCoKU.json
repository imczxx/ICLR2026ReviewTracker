To address this challenge, we employ the PAC-Bayes information bottleneck framework to systematically quantify the information density of three generation paradigms: Scaffold Hopping (SH), Side-Chain Decoration (SC), and De Novo Design (DN). Our analysis reveals that SH possesses the highest information density, which tightens the model's generalization bound and enhances its transferability compared to conventional de novo generation. Motivated by this finding, we propose IBEX, a novel decoupled generation framework. IBEX is trained exclusively on the information-rich SH task to structure its latent representation of chemical space, which is then directly applied to de novo generation in a zero-shot transfer setting. Subsequently, a rapid physical refinement module utilizes the L-BFGS algorithm to optimize each conformer's geometry and binding compatibility by adjusting five short-range interaction terms and six degrees of freedom. Evaluated in a rigorous zero-shot setting on the CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based dataset, IBEX demonstrates substantial improvements over the TargetDiff baseline. It increases the docking success rate from 53% to 64% and improves the average Dock score from -7.41 to -8.09 kcal/mol. Notably, IBEX achieves a superior median Vina energy in 57 out of 100 binding pockets. Furthermore, IBEX enhances drug-likeness by approximately 25% while maintaining state-of-the-art validity and diversity, all corresponding to a demonstrably reduced generalization error. Our results validate that this decoupled approach, which synergizes information-dense pre-training with physical refinement, enables robust zero-shot structure generation and cross-pocket generalization in data-limited regimes.", "tldr": "The superiority of scaffold-hopping–focused training is validated both theoretically and experimentally.", "keywords": ["Molecular Generation", "Diffusion Model", "Information Bottleneck"], "primary_area": "applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/802ed4ce8788b215885a2cf8be663ed59d89290d.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a475b4c4b365076ef28c8883d75263de2722c3d7.pdf"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "Decoupled, coarse-to-fine generator that learns to generate ligands with a diffusion model, then applies a lightweight physics refinement to polish poses.

The de novo task is realistic, but the SC and SH tasks are not very realistic in my opinion.  First, SC would be somewhat close to a lead optimization task, but usually in lead optimization you already have side chains and you want to modify or expand them to increase activity. Second, SH is not realistic because scaffold hopping involves searching for both a new scaffold and new sidechains, not just a new scaffold. Setting the sidechains in place in particular is not representative of a scaffold hopping project. Because of these definitions used (which is understandable given the difficulty of setting up a apples-to-apples comparison), I don't think the result that SH is the best datasource to use is very meaningful. This calls the theoretical analysis part of this paper into question, but I think the empirical results are still interesting. Other weaknesses include:\n\n1. Novelty is claimed in the physics refinement process, but I don't see how this is different from a standard force field minimization (which can include having a rigid ligand).\n2. As far as I can tell, the physics refinement process is not applied to the baselines. This makes for an unfair comparison, because physical refinement is used for ligands generated by IBEX but not baselines.\n3. Fig 1 is very confusing and looks AI generated... I would consider removing this or remaking it from scratch"}, "questions": {"value": "1. Why not use a standard forcefield for the physics refinement process, instead of a custom function?\n2.
