While recent domain generalization methods perform well under the closed-set assumption, they struggle in open-set settings by misclassifying unknown objects as one of the known classes. To address this challenge, we propose a unified framework that explicitly models unknowns and improves robustness to both semantic and visual domain shifts. First, to provide supervision for unknown regions, we generate realistic unknown objects using Stable Diffusion and insert them into source images, allowing the model to learn unknown-aware representations via segmentation head expansion. However, since synthetic unknowns may not reflect the true distribution of unknowns in target domains, we introduce a meta-learning strategy that partitions the unknown set into meta-train and meta-test subsets, guiding the model to generalize across unseen unknown categories through entropy-based rejection and subdomain shifts. Finally, to reduce confusion between unknowns and visually similar known classes, we optimize the decision boundaries in feature space by enforcing compactness for known classes and expanding the unknown using Mixup-based hard negative synthesis.

To compensate for the lack of unknown-class data, the framework generates realistic unknown objects using Stable Diffusion from an auxiliary vocabulary (e.g., CIFAR-100) and pastes them into source images, providing explicit pixel-level supervision for a dedicated unknown class.\n2. To prevent the model from overfitting to the specific synthetic unknowns, a meta-learning strategy is introduced. The set of synthetic unknowns is partitioned into meta-train and meta-test subsets. The model learns from the meta-train set with standard supervision and is guided to reject the unseen meta-test set using an entropy-based loss, promoting a more general representation of \"unknown\". This is combined with a simple appearance-based subdomain split to simulate domain shifts.\n3. A feature space regularization scheme is proposed to reduce confusion between known classes and visually similar unknowns. This includes (a) Prototype-Based Compactness to tighten known-class feature clusters using Mahalanobis distance and (b) Mixup-Based Expansion to create hard-negative samples by mixing generated images of known classes and their most similar unknown prototypes, thereby expanding the unknown decision boundary.\n4.

The use of CIFAR-100  as the source for unknown prompts seems poorly matched to the target domains (urban driving scenes). The unknowns in Figure 1 are \"person\" and \"traffic sign\", which are not in CIFAR-100. While MUG is meant to generalize, starting with a more relevant vocabulary (e.g., non-target classes from COCO) seems more logical.\n3. The paper frames OSDG-SS by combining three distinct challenges: segmentation, domain generalization, and open-set recognition. However, one might question the practical significance of this specific problem formulation in the current landscape. With the rapid advancement of powerful, large-scale foundation models for segmentation, which are trained on web-scale data, the combined challenge of domain shift and open-set rejection may be substantially mitigated or rendered less critical. Furthermore, the proposed method is validated on relatively small-scale synthetic-to-real datasets (e.g., GTA/SYNTHIA to Cityscapes). This validation is insufficient to conclusively demonstrate the method's effectiveness, especially when the core premise is to build a model robust enough for real-world deployment where the variety of domains and unknown objects is far greater."}, "questions": {"value": "The most important question is weakness3.
