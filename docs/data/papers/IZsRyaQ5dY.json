In parameter-isolation CL, existing approaches typically learn dense task masks via backpropagation, which couples mask learning to the backbone optimiser, adds training compute, and inflates\nmemory with extra mask parameters.\nWe introduce HebbGate, a parameter-isolation method for continual learning that uses local, reward-modulated gates in place of backpropagated masks. Crucially, each task adds just one scalar per channel (not per weight), keeping memory growth tiny and the masks interpretable. A simple utilisation penalty discourages reuse of over-popular channels, and a $\\kappa$-decay capacity warm-up lets new tasks explore larger masks before annealing to the target sparsity, mitigating order bias and improving forward transfer.\nFor class-incremental evaluation, we replicate each sample across all task-masks and perform one fused forward pass.\nHebbGate is equally effective when applied to a two‑layer MLP, a shallow CNN, or a gated ResNet‑18. On Permuted‑MNIST, Split‑CIFAR‑10, and CIFAR-100, it matches the accuracy of gradient‑based masking methods while keeping the parameter footprint essentially unchanged. HebbGate, therefore, offers a lightweight, transparent alternative for exemplar-free, single-head continual learning.", "tldr": "HebbGate applies a local, reward‑modulated Hebbian rule to create sparse task‑specific subnetworks, delivering fast continual learning with minimal extra memory.", "keywords": ["Continual Learning", "Incremental Learning", "Hebbian Plasticity", "Local Learning Rules"], "primary_area": "transfer learning, meta learning, and lifelong learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c4e15340ca47b7cbab5888e49c1c5ecf31a2e98e.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes a gating method for parameters based on a reward modulated Hebbian rule, in which one scalar is added per neuron instead of per weight.

We additionally report a forward-transfer proxy $F$ that measures the average gain on new tasks. An illustrative excerpt of these metrics on ResNet-18 is shown below, supporting claims about transfer and order robustness:\n| Setting   |  Dataset      | BWT (mean ± std) |  $F$  |\n| --------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |\n| CIL | CIFAR-100    | −4.35 ± 0.72     | 4.78 ± 0.70                    |\n| CIL | ImageNet-100 | −5.48 ± 1.50     | 6.72 ± 1.11                    |\n\n### Closing\nThe reviewers identified a number of common concerns, primarily about benchmarks, baselines, and metrics.  \nThe changes above directly address these points and substantially strengthen the empirical and methodological foundation of the work, without altering the core HebbGate mechanism.  \nAll of these updates will be reflected in the revised manuscript that will be uploaded in the next few days.
