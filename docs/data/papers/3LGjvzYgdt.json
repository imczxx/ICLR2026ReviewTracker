Recent work uses large foundation Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as zero-shot reward models, computing text–observation similarity to bypass manual reward engineering. Although promising, these rewards are noisy, brittle, and misaligned with ground-truth objectives. We introduce Structure-Aware Fine-Tuning (SAFT), a lightweight, LoRA-based method that adapts frozen VLM reward models online using simple structural priors. SAFT enforces invariances and proportionality in the reward signal via augmentations and auxiliary losses, yielding smoother and more consistent reward landscapes. Experiments across classic control and robotic manipulation tasks show faster policy convergence, substantially improved alignment with ground-truth rewards, and elimination of the extensive human annotation effort that Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) would otherwise require. These results establish structure-aware fine-tuning as a simple path toward stable, text-conditioned reinforcement learning.", "tldr": "Reward design in RL is hard.

Structure-aware fine-tuning (SAFT) that encodes geometric/temporal invariants; plausible inductive bias."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "As currently written, this paper lacks sufficient information to be reproduced or reviewed. The central issue is that the authors do not specify what loss function is used for pre-training the VLM for experiments in sections 4.2 and 4.3. The language of section A.2 (and in general, the rest of the paper) is highly ambiguous and extremely lacking in clearly-articulated details. Two sensible interpretations can be identified:\n\n- Interpretation 1: The pre-training loss is the dense ground truth (GT) rewards the authors manually engineer for each task (which, incidentally, is only explicitly defined for some environments; but is not for the CartPole one, notably; also compromising reproducibility). \n- Interpretation 2: The pre-training loss is their CAL/RLR objectives (which also require per-environment manual work, but are at least unsupervised).\n\nLanguage by the authors would suggest the first interpretation (\"This pretraining is performed online by regressing the VLM reward predictions toward the true task rewards.\"), which at least we know to apply to section 4.3; however, whether it also applies to results in 4.2 is unclear, as the grammar of this paragraph is poor.\n\nIf the method the authors used for their results is Interpretation 1 (\"pre-training loss = dense GT rewards\"), this would imply full leakage of the manually designed ground truth to the VLM, and invalidate all evidence the paper presents in support of their method and make most of their statements false, given the problem they purport to solve: avoiding the expensive and manual design of reward functions and replacing them with reward signals from vision-language models. At that point, in their experiments, all they show is that the VLM becomes, at best, a way to map from pixel observations to the state space, which is, granted, an interesting avenue of research, but not related to the claims of the paper, and requiring entirely different evaluation baselines. This would not, in principle, refute the validity of the method (it could still be a good method), but it would fully invalidate any evidence in support of it. Of course one would expect to find that such a method would \"substantially improve alignment with ground-truth rewards\", since the authors are training on the evals!\n\nIf, in contrast, Interpretation 2 is true (\"pre-training loss = CAL/RLR objectives introduced by the authors\"), then the baseline is just an ablation of the author's own method; claims should be framed as \"online SAFT improves over offline SAFT-style pretraining\" and the like; and, in any case, never \"over zero-shot VLM\", which is the central framing of the paper. There is nothing zero-shot about pre-training a VLM per-task, using per-task knowledge. Only if the pre-training were cross-task or, being per-task, used a loss function that depended in no way on knowledge about the task, would it make sense to talk about \"zero-shot\". Either way, the absolute non-negotiable baseline needed if Interpretation 2 is true would be to compare the results with a _frozen_ VLM (no pre-training). Assuming the results turned out to be positive (I find this plausible), I would still reject the vast majority of the claims and language used in the draft. A full re-framing of the results would be required to pass academic integrity standards, though could be still a very valuable contribution to the literature. Knowledge of geometric invariants about tasks is an extremely strong assumption when trying to jump from toy CartPole examples to general-purpose robotics tasks. The strength of VLMs for reinforcement learning is that knowledge about these invariants _emerges_ during pre-training due to the downstream generalization capabilities of foundation models. Any attempt to improve on this method should either (1) be comparably general or (2) clearly frame and explain the specific extent of applicability of the additional assumptions introduced. For example, for the latter, geometric invariants are cooked into physics-informed neural networks regularly, because the relationship between the assumptions made and the problem they solve is self-evident. To make the author's method valuable, they would have to either (1) significantly adapt their language, to make it clear to readers the obvious caveats of the approach instead of burying it at the end, or (2) provide a serious discussion of the extension capability of their method, which could well be, for all I know, widely extensible to more complex tasks, subject to evidence of it being provided.\n\nThe paper has a few other smaller issues, but those are inconsequential relative to the aspects outlined above.\n\nIf the authors were to entirely remove any per-task pretraining, updated all their experiments, and the results were still very strong (subject to seriously improving the writing with more clarity on reproducibility, added source code, etc.), my estimation of the paper's quality would significantly change; I'd rate it a 6 or 8, depending on specifics."}, "questions": {"value": "Pretraining loss.

We are encouraged that the reviewers found the problem setting interesting and the approach novel. Based on your comments, we have updated the manuscript to improve clarity, reproducibility, and evaluation rigor. Below is a summary of the major changes and a clarification of our core methodological scope.\n\n### **1. Summary of Updates to the Manuscript**\n\nIn response to specific reviewer requests, we have added the following to the revised paper:\n\n- **Clarification of Pretraining (Appendix A.3):** A dedicated section detailing the pretraining rationale, the regression target (ground-truth task reward), and the shaping terms used. We clarify that this serves to interpolate between weak and strong base models to measure relative improvement, not to leak ground-truth data.\n\n- **PbRL-Pretrained Evaluation (Appendix B.6):** New results demonstrating SAFT’s effectiveness on a model pretrained via PbRL without access to ground-truth reward values, addressing concerns about dependence on regression-based pretraining.\n\n- **Off-the-Shelf ViT Evaluation (Figure S9):** Training curves for SAFT applied to an off-the-shelf ViT-B16 across all environments over an increased number of seeds.\n\n- **Window Size Ablations (Appendix B.4):** An ablation study on the window size _W_, demonstrating its effect on the strength of the RLR prior.\n\n### **2. Clarification on Scope and \"Leakage\"**\n\nA primary concern raised (Reviewer _**fyXP**_) was whether pretraining the VLM on ground-truth rewards constitutes \"training on the evaluation set.\" We fundamentally clarify our contribution:\n\n- **Goal:** We do not claim to solve the problem of creating rewards from scratch (as VLM-RMs do [1]). We claim to improve the reward landscape of existing imperfect VLM-RMs.\n\n- **Methodology:** To evaluate this delta, we require base models of varying quality. Pretraining via regression is a controlled mechanism to generate these base models, allowing us to systematically evaluate SAFT across the spectrum of VLM capabilities, from \"barely working\" to \"near-perfect.\"\n\n- **Validity:** As evidenced by our new experiments on off-the-shelf models and PbRL-pretrained models, SAFT functions independently of how the base model was created.\n\n### **3. Choice of Baselines and Environments**\n\nWe reiterate our rationale for the experimental setup:\n\n- **Baselines:** We compare against VLM-RM [1], the only methodologically consistent baseline. We exclude RoboCLIP [2] (video-based/trajectory-level) and FuRL [3] (requires privileged ground-truth sparse rewards) as they operate under fundamentally different assumptions and input modalities.\n\n- **Environments:** We utilize Allegro Repose Cube (72-dim observation, 16-dim action) as our high-dimensional benchmark. We omit the Humanoid task used in prior work because it relies on a modified static goal (e.g. \"kneeling\") rather than dynamic motion (e.g. \"walking\") due to VLM limitations, and lacks a rigorous ground-truth reward for quantitative evaluation through policy curves and EPIC distance.\n\n### **4. Reproducibility**\n\nWe have provided an anonymous link to the code in our individual response to Reviewer _**fyXP**_ and commit to releasing a fully cleaned and documented version upon acceptance.\n\nWe believe these updates and clarifications address the core concerns regarding the validity and fairness of our evaluation. We thank the reviewers once again for all their effort and helping us in strengthening this work!\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Rocamonde et al. \"Vision-language models are zero-shot reward models for reinforcement learning\" ICLR 2024\n\n[2] Sontakke et al. \"RoboCLIP: One Demonstration is Enough to Learn Robot Policies\" NeurIPS 2023\n\n[3] Fu et al. \"FuRL: Visual-language models as fuzzy rewards for reinforcement learning\" ICML 2024"}}, "id": "t5AYLxPoX2", "forum": "3LGjvzYgdt", "replyto": "3LGjvzYgdt", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9716/Authors"], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9716/Authors"], "number": 7, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9716/-/Official_Comment"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1763735001541, "cdate": 1763735001541, "tmdate": 1763739472892, "mdate": 1763739472892, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Comment", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": false}
