Previous works often focus on extending input sequence length to locate distal enhancers, which may influence target genes from hundreds of kilobases away. Our work first reveals that for current models, long sequence modeling can decrease performance. Even carefully designed algorithms only mitigate the performance degradation caused by long sequences. Instead, we find that proximal multimodal epigenomic signals near target genes prove more essential. Hence we focus on how to better integrate these signals, which has been overlooked. We find that different signal types serve distinct biological roles, with some directly marking active regulatory elements while others reflect background chromatin patterns that may introduce confounding effects. Simple concatenation may lead models to develop spurious associations with these background patterns. To address this challenge, we propose Prism (**P**roximal **r**egulatory **i**ntegration of **s**ignals for **m**RNA expression levels prediction), a framework that learns multiple combinations of high-dimensional epigenomic features to represent distinct background chromatin states and uses backdoor adjustment to mitigate confounding effects.

To address this issue, the authors propose a causal framework that learns multiple background chromatin states and applies backdoor adjustment to isolate true causal effects of regulatory signals.

Naive modelling, with all of the signals, may render the model to learn spurious relations, the effects of which are demonstrated in figure 1 e/f.\n\n**Solution (S)**\n\nTo mitigate the confounding effects Prism is introduced, an approach that: \n1. learns high-dimensional feature combinations to represent background chromatin states, and \n2. makes a prediction for each state and averages them (backdoor adjustment) to reduce confounding. Training uses three losses: prediction, intervention (on the averaged prediction), and a uniformity loss that promotes diversity in the learned weights.\n\n**Contributions (C)**\n1. The authors challenge the focus on long-sequence modeling for gene expression, showing it does not necessarily help with current tools. \n2. They analyze roles of signals and point out that background chromatin patterns can confound models.\n3. Introduce and evaluate Prism.

The paper picks upon a prevalent issue in long-context DNA sequence modelling. The authors narrow down on the key-issue and validate it experimentally. \n2. Within gene expression prediction, using latent background-state weights + uniform backdoor averaging is relatively novel.\n3. While most baselines are trained and reported at 200k bp, Prism runs at 2k bp and still beats prior SOTA (Table 1).

Prism completely discards long-range sequence information by design, operating on only 2kbp. This is presented as a strength, but I believe that this is also a fundamental limitation. The model cannot discover regulatory elements or sequence variations beyond its 2kbp window unless their effects are already captured by the provided proximal epigenomic signals. Have the authors explored how the metrics change when we increase the context? Why was 2k chosen?\n\n2. Results in Table 1 are based on only two human cell lines, K562 and GM12878. While these are standard benchmarks, gene regulation is notoriously complex and cell-type specific.
