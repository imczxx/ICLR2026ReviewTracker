To address this, we introduce Forgery Attribution Report Generation, a new multimodal task that jointly localizes forged regions (\"Where\") and generates natural language explanations grounded in the editing process (\"Why\"). This dual-focus approach goes beyond traditional forensics, providing a comprehensive understanding of the manipulation. To enable research in this domain, we present **M**ulti-**M**odal **T**amper **T**racing (**MMTT**), a large-scale dataset of 152,217 samples, each with a process-derived ground-truth mask and a human-authored textual description, ensuring high annotation precision and linguistic richness. We further propose ForgeryTalker, a unified end-to-end framework that integrates vision and language via a shared encoder (image encoder + Q-former) and dual decoders for mask and text generation, enabling coherent cross-modal reasoning. Experiments show that ForgeryTalker achieves competitive performance on both report generation and forgery localization subtasks, i.e., 59.3 CIDEr and 73.67 IoU, respectively, establishing a baseline for explainable multimedia forensics.

Converting the class labels to coherent sentences is a trivial task for the MLLM, so the effectiveness of the architecture is a little misleading. Of course, the pipeline still works, but it seems overkill --i.e. why convert a set of class labels to sentences if they are already human-readable? The architecture would make more sense in a VQA format.\n- The architecture seems to be trained only on forgeries. As such, we should expect some hallucinations and false positives on real images.

The paper does not explain why Q-former is necessary over the now-standard image encoder + LLM architecture. An ablation comparing direct ViT features + LLM versus the Q-former approach would help justify this design choice.\n\n4.
