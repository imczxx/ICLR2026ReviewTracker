This paper introduces KITINet (KInetics Theory Inspired Network), a way that reinterprets feature propagation through the lens of non-equilibrium particle dynamics and partial differential equation (PDE) simulation. We propose a  new residual module that models feature updates as the stochastic evolution of a particle system, numerically simulated via a discretized solver for the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE). This formulation mimics particle collisions, enabling additional neuron-wise information propagation via physical interactions. Additionally, we reveal that this mechanism is an implicit regularization approach that induces network parameter condensation during training, where parameters progressively concentrate into a sparse subset of dominant channels. Experiments on large language modeling, image classification, scientific computation, and text classification show consistent improvements over classic network baselines, without additional inference cost.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Physics Inspired Neural Network", "Kinetic Theory"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/7fd9586a3b4199435eb496b8932d4b70a55db5e4.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors propose a new way of combining the residual stream and processed activations in residual layers. Inspired by Neural ODEs, they consider the residual stream as position $x$ and the processed activations as velocity $v$ for which they reshape the hidden feature dimension into a particle simulation that they simulate for one time step. This mechanism is only active during training. It falls back to simple residual-stream addition during inference. The authors argue that their method improves parameter condensation since particle collisions cause spatial distributions to be more dispersed. Since residual layers are common in most modern deep learning architectures, their extension can be monkey-patched into various networks for different tasks. The authors demonstrate this with GPT-like next-token prediction, ResNet-style image classification, PDE operator learning, and BERT-like text classification, for which they report improvements over the baseline."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "- The authors make an interesting connection to kinetic gas theory. \n- They use a wide range of experiments and can consistently demonstrate an improvement over the chosen baseline (even if it might not hold in the strictest statistical setting).\n- The modification they suggest seems plug-and-play and should allow for easy integration into existing architectures.

However, I'm not strongly familiar with benchmarks in that domain. On the front of PDEs, the selection of benchmarks could be strengthened. To fully evaluate the method's efficacy against the current state-of-the-art and ensure fair comparisons, it would be beneficial to test it on more recent, standardized benchmarks.
