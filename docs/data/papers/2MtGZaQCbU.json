To alleviate this extensive manual effort, researchers have investigated machine learning methods for automatically programming the hardware description language (HDL) code, and have achieved success in designing combinational circuits. However, due to the complexity of internal state transitions, the design accuracy for sequential circuits remains insufficient for practical applications, whereas the design accuracy of combinational circuits can achieve 99.99999999999%.\n\nThis paper proposes a novel machine learning model, Circuit HMM, a deterministic Hidden Markov Model (HMM), for accurately designing sequential circuits. Our key insight is that the input-output relationship of the sequential circuits can be formalized as a Markov Process, significantly reducing the design space. With this computationally efficient model, we prove that the design accuracy of the sequential circuit converges to 100% with linear complexity. Circuit HMM (1) first learns the hidden states by constructing an effective finite state machine (FSM) by heuristic **state mining**, which ensures the error rate caused by the inaccurate states converges to zero; (2) accurately transforms the sequential circuit design problem into a series of combinational circuit design problems by efficient **state encoding**; and (3) then learns the combinational circuit implementation from the input-output relations with a state-of-the-art logic regression tool, i.e. the BSD Learner, which ensures the combinational error rate converges to zero. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately design real-world circuit modules comprising up to 5,000 logic gates, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art.

Since HMM itself is a classical sequential modeling framework, the primary contribution lies in its deterministic adaptation and engineering workflow optimization. Moreover, the state mining (reliant on BFS and Monte Carlo) and the encoding optimization (dependent on Simulated Annealing) constitute applications or improvements of well-established algorithms, and thus the work does not present fundamental algorithmic originality.\n2. The paper does not explicitly state whether its assumptions are valid for all sequential circuit types, such as asynchronous or circuits with complex feedback. The validation is solely based on experiments with synchronous circuits.\n3. The paper lacks ablation studies for some modules. It fails to verify the necessity of the BSD Learner module. How would accuracy and efficiency change if BSD were replaced with other combinational circuit learning tools (e.g., a BDD Learner)? Alternatively, if the SA-based encoding optimization were removed, how much would the circuit size increase? Including such experiments would strengthen the validation of the method's effectiveness.\n4. The study does not test the performance on extreme-scale circuits (e.g., those with 10,000+ gates), nor does it analyze the efficiency degradation of state mining when the number of states becomes very large (e.g., exceeding 10⁴).

While it is directly referenced from (Cheng, 2024a), I feel that the actual problem in this paper is different. The input is not a fixed dataset of $N$ input-output pairs, but rather a black-box sequential circuit, which can be interacted by any inputs during the algorithmic process. I think only in such a way can the random generation of PIs (line 252) make sense. \n- The impact of the paper is not clearly presented. Given that the target sequential circuit does exist and can be interacted, the paper is more likely a \"reverse engineering\" of an existing sequential circuit design, rather than learning a design from scratch based on examples of input-output pairs. It is not clear to me how the proposed approach can be integrated into existing EDA tools (line 1014).\n- The comparison with baselines methods (Transformer, LSTM, BSD) is not very fair. The proposed approach can interact with the oracle with arbitrary inputs (online), while the other approaches learn on a fixed dataset (offline).
