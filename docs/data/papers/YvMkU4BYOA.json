The attempt to incorporate model-based feature attribution (SHAP) into a scoring criterion is conceptually novel and could inspire follow-up research.\n2.\tClear experimental setup.\nThe evaluation uses well-known benchmark networks (Asia, Child, Alarm, Hailfinder, etc.) from the bnlearn repository, which allows for some reproducibility and comparability of results.\n3.\tPotential for cross-pollination with machine learning methods.\nIntegrating XGBoost-based attribution measures into causal-structure scoring is a creative idea that could, with further development and theoretical grounding, suggest ways to combine predictive modeling and causal discovery frameworks."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1.\tUnreliable benchmarking and unfair baselines.\nThe paper reports that GES “did not finish within seven days” on networks of 56–76 variables, which is inconsistent with known implementations (e.g., Tetrad, bnlearn) that complete such tasks in seconds. This strongly suggests an inefficient or incorrect implementation. As a result, the comparative runtime and performance claims are not credible.\n2.\tLack of methodological clarity.\nThe XBIC algorithm is never presented in a self-contained form. There is no pseudocode, clear procedural description, or specification of how the SHAP-weighted penalty integrates into the search process. This makes it impossible to reproduce or verify the reported results.\n3.\tWeak theoretical grounding.\nThe proposed modification of BIC is heuristic. The claim that XBIC “preserves consistency” is asserted without proof, and no argument is given that the SHAP-weighted penalty yields correct model selection under standard assumptions. The theoretical contribution is therefore minimal.\n4.\tExcessive computational cost.\nEach node-level model requires an XGBoost and SHAP computation, resulting in orders-of-magnitude higher runtime than standard BIC or GES. The paper acknowledges this overhead but does not justify it in terms of improved accuracy or scalability.\n5.\tLimited and potentially biased empirical evaluation.\nExperiments are confined to small and medium discrete networks and omit widely used baselines such as MMHC, FGES with standard caching, and more recent hybrid or score-based methods. The evaluation also uses incomplete DAGs (from PC and GES) without orientation repair, which biases the results in favor of XBIC.\n6.\tOverstated claims.\nThe paper repeatedly asserts that XBIC “outperforms GES and PC” and that GES is impractical for moderately large networks. Given the evidence, these claims are not supported. The method is an exploratory heuristic, not a practical or theoretically justified replacement for established algorithms.\n7.\tPresentation issues.\nThe exposition is uneven: the technical content is embedded in prose, with critical steps scattered across sections. Key ideas (e.g., why SHAP values should adjust BIC penalties) are described only qualitatively, and notation is inconsistently introduced."}, "questions": {"value": "1.\tGES runtime discrepancy.\nThe paper reports that GES “did not finish within seven days” on networks with 56–76 variables. Could the authors clarify exactly which implementation was used (e.g., Tetrad, bnlearn, or a custom version), whether score caching was enabled, and if family scores were recomputed at every iteration? Since standard implementations complete these same benchmarks in seconds, such details are critical to understanding whether the reported runtime reflects algorithmic limitations or configuration choices.\n2.\tAlgorithmic specification.\nAlgorithm 2 outlines a hill-climbing framework for structure learning with XBIC, but several key steps remain underspecified. Could the authors define precisely how the SHAP-weighted penalty modifies the BIC score, whether SHAP values are recomputed or reused after each graph modification, and how local score caching is handled? These aspects are necessary to reproduce the results and to evaluate the claimed runtime overhead.\n3.\tFairness of baseline evaluation.\nFor PC and GES, the paper states that undirected edges were randomly oriented before computing F-scores. Random completions can introduce orientation noise and systematically penalize these methods. Would the authors consider evaluating on essential graphs (CPDAGs) or providing separate metrics for adjacency and orientation accuracy? Clarifying this would make the comparisons more interpretable.\n4.\tTheoretical justification.\nSection 4.3 claims that XBIC “remains asymptotically consistent.” Could the authors specify under what assumptions this holds—e.g., whether the SHAP-weighted penalty satisfies score equivalence and decomposability—and provide at least a proof sketch or argument? Without these conditions, it is unclear how XBIC retains the statistical guarantees of standard BIC.\n5.\tScalability claims.\nThe paper characterizes XBIC as “large-scale” and “dimension-adaptive,” yet all benchmarks involve fewer than 100 variables. Could the authors clarify whether “large-scale” refers to theoretical complexity, sample-size adaptation, or empirical scalability? If they expect the method to scale to hundreds or thousands of nodes, some runtime or complexity analysis would be helpful.\n6.\tInterpretability of SHAP weighting.\nThe proposed use of SHAP values as an adaptive regularizer is intriguing but not theoretically motivated. Could the authors provide intuition or formal reasoning showing why this weighting should improve orientation or structure accuracy beyond empirical observation? For example, is the weighting expected to approximate a sparsity-inducing prior or adjust for variable importance bias?\n7.\tPractical trade-offs.\nBecause each node-level model involves XGBoost training and SHAP evaluation, XBIC appears substantially more expensive than conventional score-based methods. Could the authors discuss concrete settings where this cost is justified—e.g., small, high-noise discrete datasets—or whether approximate SHAP computations or parallelization could mitigate runtime? Quantifying the trade-off would clarify XBIC’s practical niche.\n8.\tAdditional baselines.\nSince all datasets are discrete bnlearn networks, it would be informative to compare XBIC against modern discrete score-based algorithms such as BOSS (Andrews et al., 2023) or GRaSP, which achieve strong accuracy and scalability on the same benchmarks. Such comparisons would help determine whether XBIC’s reported improvements arise from the scoring function itself or from implementation differences in the search procedure."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "qVCyJZSMhv", "forum": "YvMkU4BYOA", "replyto": "YvMkU4BYOA", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19086/Reviewer_Evmc"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19086/Reviewer_Evmc"], "number": 1, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission19086/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761693406963, "cdate": 1761693406963, "tmdate": 1762931109639, "mdate": 1762931109639, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes XBIC, a BIC-style score that down-weights the model complexity penalty using edge-level “directional evidence” derived from TreeSHAP attributions of per-node classifiers.

The paper itself notes small-sample regimes where XBIC effectively reduces to BIC (few confident predictions).\n\n4. Evaluation design likely favors the proposed method. PDAG completion by random orientation: For baselines that output CPDAGs (e.g., PC), the paper randomly orients undirected edges to form a DAG before directed-edge scoring. This can artificially depress baseline precision/recall on directed edges. More appropriate is CPDAG-aware metrics or reporting “correctly oriented compelled edges.” XBIC enjoys heavy per-node tuning (Optuna over many XGBoost hyperparameters) while there is no evidence that comparable hyperparameter sweeps were performed for the baselines (e.g., PC test selection, GES score variants).\n\n5.
