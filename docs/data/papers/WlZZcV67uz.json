Airborne systems face a fundamental challenge in extracting the necessary geomagnetic field data: the aircraft itself induces magnetic noise, which needs to be removed. While the classical Tolles-Lawson model addresses this, it inadequately handles stochastically corrupted magnetic data needed for operational navigation.\nTo handle stochastic noise, we propose a novel approach using two physics-based constraints: divergence-free vector fields and E(3)-equivariance. Our constraints guarantee that the generated magnetic field obeys Maxwell's equations, and ensure that outputs change appropriately with sensor position/orientation. The divergence-free constraint is implemented by defining a neural network outputting vector potential A, with the magnetic field constructed as its curl. For E(3)-equivariance, we use tensor products of geometric tensors representable using spherical harmonics with well-known rotational transformations. By enforcing physical consistency and constraining the space of admissible field functions, our formulation acts as an implicit regularizer, improving spatiotemporal performance. \nWe conduct ablation studies evaluating these constraints' individual and combined effects across CNNs, MLPs, Liquid Time Constant Models, and Contiformers. We note that continuous-time dynamics and long-term memory are critical for modelling magnetic time-series data; the Contiformer architecture, which inherently possesses both, surpasses state-of-the-art methods in our experiments. To handle data scarcity, we develop synthetic datasets by utilising the World Magnetic Model (WMM) in conjunction with time-series conditional GANs, generating realistic and temporally consistent magnetic field sequences spanning various trajectory patterns and environmental scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that embedding these constraints significantly improves predictive accuracy and physical plausibility outperforming the state-of-the-art across both classical and unconstrained deep learning approaches.", "tldr": "Closed-form solution for Contiformer Using Damped Harmonic Oscillators", "keywords": ["irregular time-series", "physics-aware neural networks", "magnetic navigation"], "primary_area": "learning on time series and dynamical systems", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/b88cc8ef10c63249fea0aea3c1aaeefde548d932.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The manuscript presents a method for enforcing hard divergence-free and E(3)-equivariant constraints in neural network outputs for magnetic navigation denoising.

The primary weakness of the manuscript lies in its organization and lack of clarity regarding how the proposed method performs denoising. For readers unfamiliar with magnetic navigation, it is difficult to understand the actual application workflow. For example, after Sections 3.1 and 3.2, it is clear that the network takes the spatial location $x$ as input and outputs a divergence-free, E(3)-equivariant magnetic field. However, it remains unclear how this network is used for denoising: What are the input and target data? What is the loss function? How does the network remove noise from the data in practice?\n2. The literature review and related work sections are underdeveloped. The ideas of imposing hard physical constraints and enforcing E(3)-equivariance are not novel, and relevant prior work is insufficiently discussed. This omission weakens the paper’s contribution and contextual grounding. For instance, similar divergence-free constraints have long been employed in fluid dynamics, such as predicting vorticity fields and reconstructing divergence-free velocity fields via the curl operation. The current work appears conceptually similar to these established approaches."}, "questions": {"value": "1.
