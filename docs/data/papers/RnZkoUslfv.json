This work addresses two key issues in recent Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), inspired by nonequilibrium thermodynamics: geometric feature extraction and equivariance. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a geometric approach to the prediction network of DDPMs by designing equivariant morphological partial differential equations (PDEs) for group convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs), referred to as PDE-G-CNNs. These PDEs are formulated on Riemannian manifolds to better capture nonlinearities, represent thin geometrical structures, and incorporate symmetries into the learning process. Our method achieves this by considering a system of two PDEs: a convection term and a first-order Hamilton–Jacobi-type PDE that acts as morphological multiscale dilations and erosions. Preliminary experiments on MNIST and RotoMNIST indicate significant performance gains compared to baseline DDPMs.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Diffusion models", "partial differential equations", "equivariance", "Riemannian manifolds", "symmetries"], "primary_area": "generative models", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/792489da02345a5ca845924d8c64996ec468f803.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper introduces ED2RM, a framework that extends denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) onto Riemannian manifolds through the integration of equivariant morphological PDE-G-CNN layers.

Although previous studies have explored both equivariant diffusion models and PDE-G-CNNs, the paper does not specify what limitations of DDPMs this approach addresses or what unique benefits it offers. Consequently, the contribution appears as an intuitive architectural extension rather than a response to a defined gap. \n3.\tThe paper only compares ED2RM with the standard DDPM, omitting stronger or more recent diffusion variants.

The paper conducts only preliminary experiments on MNIST and RotoMNIST, without evaluation on natural image datasets, which makes it difficult to comprehensively validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, on the MNIST dataset, the performance of ED2RM is comparable to that of the baseline DDPM, indicating that the improvement is relatively modest in simpler scenarios.\n5.\tThe paper does not include ablation studies to disentangle whether improvements stem from the equivariant design, the PDE-based layers, or the Riemannian manifold formulation.
