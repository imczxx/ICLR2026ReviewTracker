For sparse Erdős--Rényi directed acyclic graphs, where the edge probability scales as $p_e = \\Theta(1/d)$, we show that the FNR concentrates around its mean at rate $O\\bigl(\\tfrac{\\log d}{\\sqrt d}\\bigr)$, implying that large deviations above the expected error become exponentially unlikely as dimensionality increases. This concentration ensures that derived upper bounds hold with high probability in large-scale settings. Extending the analysis to generalized Barabási--Albert graphs reveals an even stronger phenomenon: when the degree exponent satisfies $\\gamma > 3$, the deviation width scales as $O\\bigl(d^{\\beta - \\frac{1}{2}}\\bigr)$ with $\\beta = 1/(\\gamma - 1) < \\frac{1}{2}$, and hence vanishes in the limit. This demonstrates that realistic scale-free topologies intrinsically regularize causal discovery, reducing variability in orientation error. These finite-dimension results provide the first dimension-adaptive, faithfulness-robust guarantees for causal structure recovery, and challenge the intuition that high dimensionality and network heterogeneity necessarily hinder accurate discovery. Our simulation results corroborate these theoretical predictions, showing that the FNR indeed concentrates and often vanishes in practice as dimensionality grows.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["causality", "causal discovery", "theoretical guarantees", "single-variable interventions", "large-scale causal discovery"], "primary_area": "causal reasoning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/c3666916c4f929bc1820d8bbe8af715d4b43fcf7.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/c037483d61b6182250a73ce264a3d22e20b640f3.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors derive high-probability deviation bounds for the (normalized) number of true edges missed due to incorrect causal ordering — that is, for the false negative rate — in the context of causal discovery with interventional data on random graphs.

Clarifying whether the theoretical results apply to the implemented algorithm—or only to its ideal global optimum—would strengthen the paper.\n2. Relation to existing permutation-based approaches.\nThe method builds on a permutation representation of DAGs, similar in spirit to prior work such as Lam, Andrews & Ramsey (2022).

The authors should clarify what aspects of their framework overcome these earlier difficulties and in what precise sense their theoretical guarantees are novel.\n3.\tComparison with continuous acyclicity formulations.\nThe paper positions its method as distinct from continuous-optimization approaches such as NOTEARS, DAG-GNN, and GOLEM, but the practical differences are not clearly explained.

Demonstrating competitive recovery or runtime behavior would help connect the theoretical framework to its practical utility.\n6.

A concise summary of the algorithmic steps would greatly aid comprehension.\n2.\tConnection between theory and practical search.\nThe theoretical guarantees are stated in terms of identifiability and dimension adaptivity, but it remains unclear how these relate to the performance of the implemented optimization. Are the guarantees properties of the objective itself (assuming global optimization), or do they also hold for the proposed search procedure in finite-sample, non-ideal conditions?\n3.\tRelation to prior permutation-based work.\nPrior studies such as Lam, Andrews & Ramsey (2022) identified both strengths and limitations of permutation-based DAG formulations. How does the present approach overcome those issues—particularly the tendency toward local minima and sensitivity to score design?
