This problem is closely related to the Gromov–Wasserstein problem, as both aim to match the geometric structures of two distributions that may differ in dimensionality. The proposed QDOT method first computes $k$ quantile means for a source and a target discrete distribution, then constructs cost matrices between the samples and the quantile means to finally use them to compute their Wasserstein distance and corresponding coupling matrix. To mitigate the computational limitations of QDOT during the Wasserstein distance computation, the authors introduce Integral QDOT, which replaces the full Wasserstein distance with the average of $d$ one-dimensional Wasserstein distances.

As a result, Integral QDOT may fail to fully reflect the structural alignment between distributions as it does account inter dimensional relationship, this can potentially oversimplify complex dependencies. This would make the method not suitable for several, if not most, of the applications.\n- There is a lack of discrete methods tested in the experimental section, methods such as (Alvarez, 2018), (Sebbouh, 2024) and (Klein, 2023) are also related and should be included to have a better understanding about the method’s performance and how it is positioned with respect to state-of-the-art approaches.\n- In Subsection 4.1, it is unclear for me why TMSE and IR were chosen as metrics as they require a known transport map $\\mathcal{T}$ (as pointed out in Appendix D.2). The details about the construction of this function are not explored in the paper and I think it is crucial to understand to which extent the reported metrics represent the alignment capabilities of the methods. More precisely, these metrics can give misleading results if $\\mathcal{T}$ only ensures that points are close in space but not truly matched. In that case, even a poor coupling $\\Pi$ could produce low TMSE or high IR scores without reflecting real alignment accuracy. \n- In addition to the previous point, no ground truth alignment or true baseline is provided; therefore it is difficult to know if the values in Table 1 actually represent a good alignment or not. I am also not sure about how the 2D projections in this experiment were obtained and why they should be used to assess the alignment abilities of the methods.\n- In addition to the previous point, no ground truth alignment or true baseline is provided; therefore it is difficult to know if the values in Table 1 actually represent a good alignment or not. I am also not sure about how the 2D projections in this experiment were obtained and why they should be used to assess the alignment abilities of the methods.\n- I believe the plot with losses (Figure 4) is not informative and I think it would be better to replace it with a figure containing the visual results of the obtained alignments for this experiment.\n- In subsection 4.3, the IQDOT method’s performance is not consistent. This is mainly seen in the experiments denoted as Mo$\\rightarrow$Sh. As the rest of the experiments (4.1 and 4.4) do not include results for IQDOT, it is difficult to ensure that this approach is suitable for them. I raise this concern as the computation of one-dimensional Wasserstein distances to obtain the coupling may restrict its applicability (as previously mentioned).\n- I have some concerns and observations regarding the experimental setup in subsection 4.4. From Table 3, it is difficult to interpret the obtained results as the metrics and the problem to solve are not properly introduced. Therefore, it is hard to say whether the obtained results represent a good alignment or not. It is important to clearly explain the metrics as they may be meaningful for different applications, but irrelevant in the case of structural alignment. Additionally, as the paper is oriented to a community mostly familiar with machine learning and artificial intelligence, I believe it is necessary to introduce the problem with more details as well as the computed metrics.\n- I think the experimental section should also report the distortion and see if it correlates with the value of QDOT. I also suggest and I think it would also be interesting to report it after step 9 and also after step 10 in Algorithm 1, this would help to understand how impactful is the use of quantile alignment while finding the optimal coupling.\n- I think the paper would benefit from including images of the obtained aligned point clouds in the case of experiments in 4.1, 4.2 and Appendix D.1. In this last case, only the noised distribution is shown and I think it is important to also add the source, target and the predicted points.\n- The paper lacks experiments on uncorrelated setups, or at least, this point is never specified in the paper. Testing the methods on source and target distributions with unknown optimal pairs is an insightful way to show the performance and limitations of a GW-like solver that aims to capture and keep the geometric structure of the distributions. The concept of (un)correlatedness has been extensively explored in (Aramayo, 2025).\n\n**Minor comments**\n- In Table 1 it is unclear for me why the Entropic Gromov-Wasserstein method is slower than QDOT if both use the same Sinkhorn solver.\n- No reference for Algorithm 2 in the main text.\n- The notation for $\\phi$ is currently confusing. In certain instances, it appears as $\\phi_{\\sharp\\mu_X}^X$, but based on the definition in Equation 6, it is unclear how the pushforward operation is being applied.\n- I believe the current notation for dimensions and number of samples is confusing and since it is used everywhere in the paper to understand the proposed ideas, I would suggest modifying it to improve the readability of the paper. One example about the importance of this appears in Definition 4 where $q$ is used to denote the quantiles while in 3.3, $q$ represents the dimensionality of the target distribution.\n- From Algorithm 1, it is unclear how the optimal coupling $\\Pi$ is computed, as the algorithm appears to only output the QDOT distance/metric. However, in Appendix D.2 (Lines 1234–1235), it is stated that the algorithm computes the coupling. Therefore, it is necessary to explicitly specify the coupling as an output in the algorithm to avoid ambiguity.\n\n**To summarize,** I believe the paper has some interesting theoretical contributions regarding the novelty of the proposed QDOT method; however, the practical aspects of the paper require major revisions. More precisely, the reported metrics seem to be not the most adequate to show the true performance of the solver and the authors should also report more insightful metrics such as the GW distortion, SInkhorn divergence or MMD. On the other hand, the proposed IQDOT method seems to be weaker as it uses an average of one-dimensional Wasserstein distances, which does not consider inter dimensional relationships and it may not be useful for more complex tasks. For these reasons, I recommend the paper to be rejected.\n\n(Alvarez, 2018) David Alvarez-Melis and Tommi Jaakkola. Gromov-wasserstein alignment of word embedding spaces.

In that case, Equation 6 shows that $\\phi^{X}(x,q)=\\||x\\||_2$ for any $q \\in (0,1)$, so QDOT compares only the radial norm distributions and can identify non‑isometric spaces with identical norm distributions, violating identity of indiscernibles without the assumption that all distributions are first centered around the origin.
