It is a good start. Another strength is that the proposed method only modifies the forward/reverse process, not network architecture—demonstrated across 4 different diffusion backbones"}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. The first major weakness is methodological. Real-world time series often exhibit cross-scale interactions, for example, amplitude modulation where a low-frequency trend affects high-frequency oscillations, or frequency-dependent dampening. Why are cross-frequency effects not included? What is the theoretical justification of why diffusion is performed component wise? Shouldn't conditional diffusion be performed? In fact, empirical justification would also have been fine, but empirical results do not show consistent improvement over the limited baselines considered.\n\n2. Compared baselines are insufficient. More non-diffusion models ( PatchTST, TimesNet, DLinear, N-BEATS etc) and other more powerful diffusion models (MrDiff, CNDiff) are missing. Atleast non-diffusion models using fourier decomposition such as TimeMixer (mentioned and cited) should have been used. Improvement over frequency aware non-diffusion baselines would give more confidence in the paper's experimental results.\n\n3. The considered datasets are inadequate to show performance. PTB-XL is not a good choice (the paper has acknowledged this, good move by the authors. But acknowledgment does not make it ok!) ECG has very regular periodic structure that is artificially favorable for the method used. It is better to replace and/or add genuine long-horizon forecasting benchmarks (e.g., Traffic, Weather from recent papers)\n\n4. Algorithm 2 requires estimating SNR values  at inference from conditioning timesteps. Distributional shift is very common in practice and may explain some negative results. Further no ablation is performed on the SNR estimation method. It is unclear how the proposed method is robust to non-stationary data.\n\n5. The paper has limited scope for application. Many real forecasting problems lack clear periodicity (e.g., financial markets, irregular events). The paper doesn't quantify how much periodicity is needed for benefits. For example, no metric is proposed to pre-assess dataset suitability. This limits practical adoption without clear applicability criteria.\n\n6. Paper claims the framework \"generalizes to any additive decomposition method\" (page 5), but there is no empirical evidence to support the methods mentioned in Appendix A.1 (wavelet or moving-average decomposition) is provided.\n\n7. The proposed method introduces substantial algorithmic complexity through frequency decomposition at each training step, K-stage sequential diffusion processing, sample-specific SNR estimation, and additional scheduler parameter tuning beyond standard diffusion hyperparameters. Despite this added complexity, improvements on certain datasets prove marginal: Temperature shows an MSE reduction from 0.0035 to 0.0024—merely 0.0011 absolute improvement on already small errors—while Solar demonstrates a decrease from 0.444 to 0.354, again in a regime where baseline errors are acceptably low. This complexity-benefit imbalance raises critical questions for practitioners who must evaluate whether the engineering overhead, computational cost, and implementation complexity justify incremental gains that may fall within statistical noise.\n\n8. Ablation studies (Appendix D.1) are conducted only on synthetic data, never validating on the main benchmarks whether multiple components genuinely help. Table 14's synthetic results paradoxically show that K=1 (MSE=0.0978) performs comparably to K=3 (MSE=0.0936), suggesting the multi-component decomposition may be unnecessary when residuals have minimal variation. The extreme sensitivity to component number K lacks practical resolution, as the proposed automatic selection method is never empirically validated.\n\n9. Visual results in Appendix G contradict performance claims: SSSD+FFT fails to capture initial dynamics, and Sashimi+FFT shows no visible improvement over baselines (scale is different so it is difficult to compare fairly).\n\n10. Results are inconsistent—with unexplained performance degradation on ETTm1 (DiffWave: 1.093 to 1.774 MSE) and SSSD on Electricity (0.957 to 1.283)—yet these results receive no investigation. \n\n11. Computational analyses are missing. The authors do not report memory complexity or FLOPs comparison, nor an inference time evaluation, despite 200-step sampling is provided.\n\n12. Minor point: The paper also writes that regular diffusion adds noise \"indiscriminately\". Well, that is the point of diffusion models, that small noise denoising at every step is learnable. If indeed we impose structure, then other mechanisms might be more beneficial and diffusion is unnecessary!"}, "questions": {"value": "1. By isolating components during diffusion, does FFT-DM fail to model cross frequency effects?
