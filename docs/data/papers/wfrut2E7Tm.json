While existing approaches tackle this via regularization, clustering, or representation learning, we introduce a novel framework inspired by causal inference that is designed to exploit latent structure linking predictors and responses. Our approach employs a new similarity-based clustering procedure guided by a metric that quantifies shared predictor-response dependencies, which tends to group variables that play similar roles with respect to (possibly latent) mediators or confounders. The resulting causality-inspired features are then incorporated into an augmented regression model, yielding sparser, more robust, and more generalizable predictions without attempting to recover the underlying causal graph. Experiments across synthetic and real-world datasets, including S&P 500 market data, demonstrate that our method achieves higher regression performance and markedly reduces overfitting compared to existing baselines.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["multi-task regression", "high-dimensional regression", "representation learning", "low-sample regression", "linear regression"], "primary_area": "unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/9f51e05c4135703eed1eac694344069a9a578985.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The authors introduce Causal Feature Augmentation (CFA), a framework for high-dimensional linear regression.

In causality, identifiability is one of the most important things. The author borrowed the terminology, but unfortunately can not provide any guarantees on the identifiability of the mediator and the latent variables in their method in any case (even if the ground-truth is Figure 1). Therefore, the title and the abstract are misleading. I would suggest that the author change it to be casality-inspired feature augmentation to make a clearer separation. \n\n2. In the setting, all predictors are assumed to be non-descendants of the response variable. I wonder why it is the case and how anti-causal relationships ($Y\\rightarrow X$) would affect the proposed framework. After all, if the response is the cause of a predictor $X$, then $X$ should also be included as an important feature.\n\n3. The mediator is simply the average of the variables in the cluster. Although it might be meaningful for some data sources, it is in general a simple approximation. I wonder whether it can be extended to an arbitrary linear transformation.\n\n4. The calculation in Table 1 is not clear to me. The probability $\\pi_m,\\pi_c$ for linking $X$ and $Z$ is missing. Shouldn't there also be a comparison with the probability of not having any mediator/confounder, i.e. direct link with the response? That would help to better assess the similarity metric.\n\n5. Since the proposed method has multiple parameters to tune, a direct comparison of the runtime is necessary to assess the practicality of the method.\n\n6. The experiments are not sufficient. For example, in the synthetic datasets, there is no test for the robustness of the method under assumption violations, e.g. alternative mediator aggregation, anticausal predictors. Only one real dataset is given, making it difficult to evaluate the performance of the method. The author could include more datasets, e.g. gene datasets like GTEx / eQTL, TCGA multi-omics, etc."}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesses."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 3}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "Pwbxdmpebh", "forum": "wfrut2E7Tm", "replyto": "wfrut2E7Tm", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5987/Reviewer_DDDW"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5987/Reviewer_DDDW"], "number": 3, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission5987/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761991825455, "cdate": 1761991825455, "tmdate": 1762918393450, "mdate": 1762918393450, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"comment": {"value": "### We thank all reviewers for their careful reading of our paper and for the constructive feedback.
