However, this service is vulnerable to safety degradation when user data includes harmful prompts, a threat known as harmful finetuning attacks.\nPrior works attempt to mitigate this issue by first constructing safety-aligned model and then finetuning the model on user data. However, we observe that the safety-aligned weights provide weak initialization for downstream task learning, leading to suboptimal safety-alignment and downstream task performance.\nTo address this, we propose a **Refusal-Teacher (Ref-Teacher)-guided finetuning framework**. \nInstead of finetuning a safety-aligned model on user data, our approach directly finetunes the base model under the guidance of a safety-aligned Ref-Teacher, which filters harmful prompts from user data and distills safety-alignment knowledge into the base model.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our Ref-Teacher-guided finetuning strategy effectively minimizes harmful outputs and enhances finetuning accuracy for user-specific tasks, offering a practical solution for secure and reliable deployment of LLMs in FaaS.", "tldr": "This paper observes that safety-aligned model weights are suboptimal for downstream task learning and then introduces a novel refusal-teacher-guided framework for safe finetuning of Large Language Models.", "keywords": ["LLM Safety", "Safe Finetuning", "Data Filtering", "Knowledge Distillation"], "primary_area": "alignment, fairness, safety, privacy, and societal considerations", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d1dd612df901fdf537111fa4cec0344dc2b70279.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/603d1a3d47d4685dccc352cb7dc90821f150d2f2.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper addresses maintaining safety alignment in LLMs under Finetuning-as-a-Service (FaaS) against malicious finetuning attacks.

Besides alignment stage defenses (baselines in the paper, such as Vaccine and Booster, fall under this), there are fine-tuning-stage defenses (e.g., SafeInstruct [Bianchi et al., 2024], VLGuard [Zong et al., 2024], constrained-SFT [Qi et al., 2024]), and post-fine-tuning defenses (e.g., SafeLoRA [Hsu et al., 2025], RESTA [Bharadwaj et al., 2024], SOMF [Yi et al., 2024],  Antidote [Huang et al., 2024]). The paper does not acknowledge the vast related work on this topic. While it is infeasible to compare against too many baselines, it is important to acknowledge the related work on this topic and provide qualitative comparisons. For fairness of comparison, it will be great if the authors can consider a couple of baselines from other setups (e.g., one from post-fine-tuning-stage and one from fine-tuning-stage) for comparison.\n\n* One of my main concerns is that the paper takes an overly simplistic approach for baselines for preserving alignment after fine-tuning -- first alignment is performed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of a base model on alignment data and then task-specific fine-tuning is performed. In practice, users significantly prefer fine-tuning instruct models. Leading instruct models take a number of steps for alignment beyond simple SFT on alignment data including RLHF via preference tuning such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) or other online RL algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Consequently, when starting from an instruct model, adaptation to the user task is often easier and the safety degradation is typically less significant. Many prior works on the topic of fine-tuning degrading safety alignment consider the case of adapting instruct (or chat) models and the impact of safety alignment (e.g., constrained-SFT [Qi et al., 2024], SafeLoRA [Hsu et al., 2025]). The paper has limited experiments in Appendix C.3 when considering instruct models as Ref-Teacher, but lacks details on using instruct models as starting points for task specific fine-tuning.\n\n* The paper does not conduct any ablation experiments to quantify the contributions of data filtering and alignment distillation.
