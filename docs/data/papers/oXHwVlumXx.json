To improve search efficiency, we propose LSI, Local Search with Indicators, a learning-based local search method for JSSP. LSI integrates scheduling-theoretic conditions as indicators into the action evaluation, enabling the policy to focus on swaps that guarantee makespan reduction. By incorporating theoretically proven conditions into the action evaluation, LSI prioritizes promising swaps rather than treating all moves equally, representing a principled improvement of makespan. Despite relying only on a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) policy network, LSI achieves competitive or superior performance compared to strong state-of-the-art approaches on diverse JSSP benchmarks, offering faster inference and robust scalability without retraining. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of embedding problem-structured theoretical principles into learning-based combinatorial optimization.", "tldr": "We integrated novel scheduling-specific properties as indicators into the action evaluation, thereby enhancing a learning-based local search method for job shop scheduling.", "keywords": ["Combinatorial Optimization", "Scheduling", "Theoretical Indicator", "Local Search"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/20c85b4f5d653569ff20cbcc2eed122b56d4f783.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces LSI, a method that integrates three theoretically derived necessary conditions as binary indicators into a policy network.

The contribution of the paper is relatively limited, as it primarily introduces three theoretical conditions without demonstrating their clear applicability to other combinatorial optimization problems.\n\n2. LSI shifts the learning paradigm from a data-driven approach to one reliant on heuristic methods by incorporating expert knowledge. This approach contradicts the field's broader goal of reducing manual intervention. The motivation and necessity of this paradigm shift require further evaluation.\n\n3. The experimental validation of the three theoretical conditions is insufficient (see Questions), which weakens their credibility and impact.\n\n4. The improvements of LSI over NeuroLS are marginal, making it difficult to justify the unique role of the three proposed conditions. It would be more convincing to apply these conditions to other learning-based methods and measure the resulting gains.\n\n5. The definition of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) state appears flawed. The embedding structure's parameters should be treated as the true state, rather than being conflated with the state representation.\n\n6.
