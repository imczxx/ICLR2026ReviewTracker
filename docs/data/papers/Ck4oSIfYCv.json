Most existing approaches rely on unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, which often struggle to learn discriminative representations and generalize to unseen cases. To overcome these issues, we propose SDGAD, a supervised framework with three main components. First, we design a residual representation that highlights deviations from historical patterns, providing strong anomaly signals. Second, we constrain the residuals of normal samples within an interval defined by two co-centered hyperspheres, ensuring consistent scales while keeping anomalies separable. Third, we use a normalizing flow to model the likelihood distribution of normal samples, treating anomalies as out-of-distribution points. Based on this distribution, we derive an explicit decision boundary and further propose a bi-boundary optimization strategy to boost generalization. Experiments on six datasets, covering both real and synthetic anomalies, show that SDGAD consistently outperforms diverse baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

The authors claim that label scarcity motivates now works, but then argue that the prevalence of unsupervised or semi-supervised methods is a problem that needs to be fixed by introducing a fully supervised method. This reasoning is conceptually inconsistent. If labels are scarce, it is perfectly reasonable for the community to focus on unsupervised or semi-supervised settings. Turning to a supervised setting does not address the stated problem; it avoids it.\n\n2. **Supervised setting reduces to standard binary classification.**\n   Once anomaly labels are available, the task essentially becomes a binary classification problem (albeit with imbalanced data). In that case, numerous well-established methods exist for handling class imbalance (e.g., weighted loss, focal loss, re-sampling, or cost-sensitive learning). The proposed method offers no clear advantage over these simpler, well-understood approaches, and the authors do not provide a convincing justification for introducing a more complex framework.\n\n3.  **Misalignment with the anomaly detection community’s focus.**\n   The current trend and practical relevance of anomaly detection lie in *unsupervised* or *semi-supervised* learning, since real-world anomalies are diverse and often lack explicit labels. Relying on labeled anomalies restricts the model to only those anomaly types seen during training, severely limiting generalization and defeating the purpose of anomaly detection. The proposed approach thus misaligns with the core philosophy and goals of the field.\n\n4. **Limited novelty and weak experimental rigor.**\n   The proposed components are rather standard and appear to be a straightforward combination of existing techniques (residual representation, boundary-based loss, and normalizing flow). There is little conceptual or algorithmic innovation. Moreover, several baselines compared in the experiments are outdated or not representative of recent state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, which undermines the fairness and credibility of the evaluation. Additionally, the relatively newer baselines are not methods in this field."}, "questions": {"value": "See weaknesss."}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "eL8ZQRQqaZ", "forum": "Ck4oSIfYCv", "replyto": "Ck4oSIfYCv", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21043/Reviewer_qcw6"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21043/Reviewer_qcw6"], "number": 2, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission21043/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761812120181, "cdate": 1761812120181, "tmdate": 1762940620043, "mdate": 1762940620043, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}, {"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper proposes SDGAD, a supervised framework for dynamic graph anomaly detection that combines three components: (1) residual representation encoding that captures deviations from historical patterns, (2) representation restriction using co-centered hyperspheres, and (3) bi-boundary optimization with normalizing flows."}, "soundness": {"value": 2}, "presentation": {"value": 2}, "contribution": {"value": 2}, "strengths": {"value": "1.

Using normalizing flows to model normal distributions and detect anomalies as out-of-distribution samples is standard practice (Kirichenko et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2021, both cited). The bi-boundary optimization (Section 4.3) essentially applies a margin to the likelihood threshold, which is conceptually similar to margin-based losses in classification (e.g., hinge loss, triplet loss).\n\n\n3. The framework requires careful tuning of multiple hyperparameters (λ₁, λ₂, rₘᵢₙ, rₘₐₓ, α, τ, L) across different components.
