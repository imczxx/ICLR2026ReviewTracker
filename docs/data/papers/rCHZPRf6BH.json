The specific formulation we use is the weighted low-rank approximation (WLRA) objective: at each step, the algorithm incurs loss equal to the weighted squared reconstruction error of the incoming point with respect to its current subspace. The goal is to minimize regret against the best rank-$k$ subspace in hindsight, whose reconstruction cost we denote by $\\mathcal{C}$. We first establish an online-to-offline reduction: the existence of an efficient no-regret online algorithm for WLRA would imply an efficient approximation scheme for the offline problem, which is unlikely under standard complexity assumptions. Although WLRA is APX-hard in the offline setting, we show that the standard Multiplicative Weights Update Algorithm (MWUA) can achieve sublinear regret in expectation with respect to a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-multiplicative approximation of $\\mathcal{C}$. Specifically, we use an adaptive spherical hierarchical region decomposition that iteratively refines the $d$-dimensional unit sphere $\\mathbb{S}^d$ based on the density of the data. At each split, a region is partitioned into $2^{d-1}$ sub-regions, producing a hierarchal tree decomposition, while our algorithm maintains centroids of the points in each region as the set of experts. Finally, we complement our theoretical results with empirical evaluations that demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm compared to previous baselines.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Low-Rank Approximation", "Online Algorithms"], "primary_area": "optimization", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/1667610c938d7993d45e035c3bc079e1966b8b43.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/75ae14230f861a6a57db4125fc06b423f6320084.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper studies the online low-rank approximation problem, where a sequence of points the goal is to find the best rank-$k$ subspace in an online fashion.

The overall algorithm, many parts of the analysis and even the experiments are very similar to that of [1]. I would argue the structure of the two papers are similar, e.g., compare Section 2 of this paper with Section 1.1 of [1]. However, authors only sparsely mentioned [1], making it hard to judge the novelty of the paper. It seems to me that the main difference is that [1] uses axis-aligned grid over $[0, 1]^d$, while this paper uses spherical HRD on $\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$? Also, in Section 3.3, authors claimed that they combine the spherical HRD of [1] and the MWU regret bound of [2], however, it seems that in [1], these two notions have already been combined and analyzed. I believe it is crucial for authors to properly cite which parts are inspired or are variants of [1], and which parts need to be adapted for low-rank approximation.\n\n2. The exponential runtime is hard to justify. While the authors argue that one can convert an online weighted low-rank approximation algorithm to an offline one, and the NP hardness [3] or even SETH hardness [4] to approximate kicks in, for standard low-rank approximation with $W$ being the all-1's matrix, polynomial time and even input sparsity time algorithms are known. Meanwhile, the proposed algorithm in this paper does not differentiate between these two cases at all. Also, I think the wording of the ``Hardness results and offline-to-online connections\" could be made more clear, i.e., the reduction is between weighted low-rank approximation (with the same weights), not that an online unweighted low-rank approximation can be reduced to an offline weighted low-rank approximation. \n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Cohen-Addad, Guedj, Kanade and Rom.
