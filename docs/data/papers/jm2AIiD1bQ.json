While existing approaches focus on token reduction or attention optimization, the fundamental challenge of reducing architectural depth while maintaining representation capacity remains largely unaddressed. We propose a novel structural reparameterization approach that enables training of parallel-branch transformer architectures which can be collapsed into efficient single-branch networks during inference. Our method progressively joins parallel branches at the inputs of non-linear functions during training. This allows the reparameterization of both the multi-head self-attention (MHSA) and feed forward network (FFN) modules during inference without approximation loss. When applied to DeiT-Tiny, our approach compresses the model from 12 layers to as few as \\{3, 4, 6\\} while preserving accuracy, delivering up to 37\\% lower inference latency on mobile CPUs for ImageNet-1K classification.

The proposed mechanism offers a new perspective demonstrating that over-parameterization during training can also enhance performance in Transformer architectures. However, I remain doubting whether the proposed approach can be rigorously categorized as a true reparameterization method (see weaknesses below)."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "While this work is interesting, there are several significant problems/questions:\n\n---\n\n1. From my perspective, structural reparameterization typically refers to a technique where multiple branches with distinct weights (i.e., diverse learned knowledge) are trained, and subsequently merged into a single branch during inference. Such train-time over-parameterization enhances the backbone’s feature extraction capability. However, in this work, all branches have already converged to identical weights after training (i.e., when $\\lambda=1$), which essentially learns the same representation across branches. Also, there is no weight merging occurring at inference; all merging operations (e.g., for $W^Q$ and $W^T$ , or $W_A$ and $W_B$) are performed either before training or during training. As a result, the benefit of multi-branch learning is unclear, and it is questionable whether this approach can be rigorously categorized as a structural reparameterization method. \n\n   In addition, although it may not be directly relevant, the proposed architecture shares certain similarities with the mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework, where multiple branches are jointly trained. It is well known that MoE models require mechanisms to prevent branches from collapsing into identical behaviors, typically through expert diversification losses [1,2]. This principle appears contrary to the training objective of the current work, which encourages all branches to converge to identical weights.\n\n---\n\n2. In addition to W1, I am also interested in how the proposed reparameterization and architectural modifications are implemented in practice. I inspected the source code provided in the supplementary material but was unable to locate the components corresponding to these mechanisms, especially the reparameterization part. The available code appears to include only the multi-branch ViT implementation. This raises concerns about the reproducibility of the proposed method. Please correct me if I miss something.\n\n---\n\n3. The experimental scope is also quite limited, as the evaluation is conducted solely on the DeiT-Tiny backbone. Given that the proposed method functions more as a plug-in applicable to existing ViTs (where the number of parallel branches depends on the number of layers of the original and reparameterized models), validating it only on such a small-scale model is insufficient. It remains uncertain whether the approach generalizes effectively to larger and more applicable ViT architectures. My humble observation in the real-world projects is that no one is really gonna use DeiT-Tiny. You need to demonstrate the effectiveness of your approach on larger ViTs or hierarchical ViTs to signify its practical value.\n\n   Furthermore, in terms of the efficiency-performance trade-off for a standalone architecture, DeiT-6-R still lags behind FastViT [3], which also incorporates structural reparameterization and is tailored for edge deployment. Specifically, FastViT-T8 achieves 75.6% accuracy with 3.6M parameters and 0.7G FLOPs, whereas DeiT-6-R attains only 70.2% accuracy with 3.1M parameters and 0.6G FLOPs. Considering the higher training cost of DeiT-6-R compared to FastViT-T8, the benefit brought by this work becomes marginal.\n\n---\n\n4. A minor presentation issue lies in the layout of Table 1, which is somewhat confusing at first glance. In Table 1, it is unclear whether the models listed are compared against the DeiT-Tiny backbone (12 layers) or only within each block of rows. Additionally, the grey-shaded rows appear visually separated, though they should logically belong to the corresponding groups with the same number of layers.Otherwise, the use of bold fonts for all grey-shaded rows seems inconsistent and potentially misleading.\n\n---\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Rajbhandari, Samyam, et al. \"Deepspeed-moe: Advancing mixture-of-experts inference and training to power next-generation ai scale.\" ICML, 2022.\n\n[2] Dai, Damai, et al. \"Deepseekmoe: Towards ultimate expert specialization in mixture-of-experts language models.\" arxiv, 2024.\n\n[3] Vasu, Pavan Kumar Anasosalu, et al. \"Fastvit: A fast hybrid vision transformer using structural reparameterization.\" ICCV, 2023."}, "questions": {"value": "Please refer to the weaknesses above.
