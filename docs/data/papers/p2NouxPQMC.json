Centered on the “AI Der Ring” framework, we integrate four dimensions of multi-agent system-enhanced operatic creation: multi-agent narrative construction, single-agent multi-role performance, dynamic scene adaptation, and interactive audience engagement. Each component leverages advanced machine intelligence to preserve Wagner’s core philosophical themes while expanding the expressive possibilities of AI-era opera.\nTo validate this framework, we implemented a multi-agent operatic simulation using YuLan-WanXiang, a next-generation social simulation platform developed by the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence at Renmin University of China. Our experiments successfully replicated key aspects of the performance pipeline, confirming the system’s stability, narrative coherence, and audience responsiveness under dynamic and distributed configurations.\nBuilding upon this foundation, we will generate four new multi-agent operas—reinterpretations of Das Rheingold, Die Walküre, Siegfried, and Götterdämmerung—to explore the full operatic cycle through the lens of distributed AI creativity. This initiative not only honors Wagner’s artistic vision but also demonstrates how multi-agent system can serve as a generative co-creator in large-scale performative arts.

Some more work on the points mentioned below could strengthen the paper.\n\nThe discussion on this particular multi-agent system only covers it conceptually. There isn’t any technical/architectural details in regard to the implementation of the multi-agent system. The methods seemingly rely on general claims. For example, “The agents communicate via a well-defined protocol that allows them to exchange ideas, provide feedback, and collectively make decisions about the narrative direction.” What protocol? And how do agents interact through it?\n\nThere also is no information regarding the evaluation framework. The scores listed in Table 2 are not defined and ungrounded. Were they human ratings or automated? Were the scores defined on a 1-5 scale? What was the sample size? What was the methodology behind the evaluation?\n\nFurthermore, the use of the YuLan-WanXiang platform is only mentioned in name; the details of the evaluation through the platform are not described in-depth. As such, the claims and conclusions from the paper are completely unreproducible, which limits its potential impact on the community.\n\nThe formatting is also quite underdeveloped.
