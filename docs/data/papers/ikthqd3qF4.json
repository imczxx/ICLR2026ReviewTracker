Some of the methods among those existing approaches could be important points of empirical comparison. It is not clearly how proposed method compares against existing baselines.\n\n- The approach relies on an accurate unconditional origination probability despite likely heterogeneity across observables and time. Because the bound uses a single p, subpopulations with lower approval rates will have fewer multiple-origination events even when merges are spurious, which could make the bound optimistic in those strata.\n\n- The assumptions of independence across borrowers and monotonicity in the number of applications are possibly strong in mortgage settings where tract-, lender-, and time-level shocks could induce correlation; the direction of bias will vary with the sign of these correlations, so sensitivity analyses would be helpful.\n\n- The empirical validation is confined to mortgages. The framing and notation are tailored to this case, which risks overstating generality; the paper would be stronger with a second, unrelated domain where an exclusivity rule holds.\n\n- As noted earlier, the clustering component is narrow relative to the entity-resolution literature. Agglomerative complete-linkage with an L2-style distance is a reasonable baseline, but there is little comparison against alternative linkage strategies such as Bayesian or probabilistic record linkage, graph-based community discovery, or modern embedding-based similarity, which makes it hard to assess performance.\n\n- The practice of dropping clusters with multiple originations both changes downstream estimands and the lower bound on algorithm precision, while introducing researcher discretion; the paper derives an adjusted bound, but it would help to articulate ex-ante decision rules or heuristics.\n\n- The claim that the rate of clustering merges is itself informative about quality is asserted in prose but not fully substantiated empirically; more direct evidence or illustration would clarify how this guidance should be operationalized.\n\n- Finally, the empirical section could be clearer about the nature of second applications—whether they are rejected-then-resubmitted cases or different-lender near-duplicates—since this affects the interpretation of some of the results."}, "questions": {"value": "- How sensitive are the precision and recall bounds to replacing the single (I believe) unconditional origination rate with subgroup-specific or time-varying rates, for example, by tract, month, lender, or applicant score bins, and does this materially change the chosen tuning parameter, epsilon?\n\n- Can the independence assumption be relaxed by allowing within-cell correlation and reporting bounds as a function of an intraclass correlation parameter, along the lines of a worst-case analysis?\n\n- What happens when there are essentially no true matches in a partition or dataset?
