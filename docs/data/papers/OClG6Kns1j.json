This paper presents a novel mechanistic interpretability framework that combines sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with causal intervention techniques to dissect cross-modal feature interactions in state-of-the-art multimodal AIGC models. We introduce the Cross-Modal Mechanistic Analysis (CMMA) methodology, which systematically identifies and manipulates interpretable features responsible for multimodal content generation. Through comprehensive experiments on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) including CLIP, LLaVA, and DALL-E variants using 2.5M carefully curated multimodal samples, our approach reveals three distinct phases of cross-modal information processing: feature extraction, modal alignment, and concept synthesis. We demonstrate that targeted interventions on discovered features can significantly improve generation quality while reducing hallucinations by $34.2\\% \\pm 2.1\\%$ ($p < 0.001$) and enhancing semantic consistency by $28.7\\% \\pm 1.8\\%$ ($p < 0.001$). Our findings provide crucial insights into the mechanistic foundations of multimodal AIGC systems and establish a roadmap for developing more interpretable and controllable generative models.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Mechanistic Interpretability", "Multimodal AI", "Sparse Autoencoders", "Causal Intervention", "AIGC Models"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/d638b19fe20d2a5415a01f7870ec3a75ec9646db.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper claims to introduce a new mechanistic interpretability framework that combines sparse autoencoders with causal interventions to analyze cross-modal feature interactions in multimodal generative models.
