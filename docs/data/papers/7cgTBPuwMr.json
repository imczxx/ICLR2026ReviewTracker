Such multi-turn agentic tasks can be naturally formalized as turn-level Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). However, most existing methods adopt MDP formulations with trajectory-level rewards, either terminal rewards that provide only a final outcome signal, or delayed rewards that merge intermediate and outcome signals into a single sparse feedback, leading to poor credit assignment. To address this limitation, we reformulate these tasks as MDPs with explicit turn-level rewards and provide theoretical analysis supporting the effectiveness of this design. Building on this formulation, we extend popular RL algorithms, GRPO and PPO, to their respective multi-turn variants, enabling fine-grained credit assignment. We conduct case studies on multi-turn reasoning-augmented search agents, where we carefully design two types of turn-level rewards: verifiable and LLM-as-judge. Our experiments on multi-turn search tasks demonstrate that our proposed formulation, incorporated well-designed turn-level rewards, enables RL algorithms to significantly outperform baseline methods with trajectory-level rewards. Both training and validation reward curves illustrate that our method achieves \\textit{greater stability}, \\textit{faster convergence}, and \\textit{higher accuracy}. Numerical results across diverse question-answering datasets further show that our approach consistently delivers highest answer correctness and 100\\% format correctness.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["multi-turn interaction", "reinforcement learning", "LLM Agent"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/6eaf9f4e41ea6d77bce0ddf013ade04b8baaf5be.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "They propose a turn-level reward design strategy to enhance RL algorithms in multi-turn agent tasks.
