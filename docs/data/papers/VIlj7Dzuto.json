In this work, we provide an information-theoretic analysis of this phenomenon and introduce REFORM (Representation formulation via multi-layer aggregation), a lightweight, training-only module designed to address this issue. REFORM hierarchically integrates hidden states across layers, leveraging local aggregation for continuity and global fusion for semantic abstraction. During training, three auxiliary objectives—correlation alignment, orthogonality, and cosine similarity—guide REFORM to restructure intermediate representations. Notably, REFORM is detached at inference time, thus incurring no runtime overhead. Extensive evaluations across Llama3, Qwen2, Mistral, and Phi-3.5 models on commonsense and mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements. Analysis using SVCCA, attention entropy, and effective rank suggests that REFORM fosters richer representations, especially in mid-to-late layers, indicating that minimal inter-layer aggregation can help alleviate structural limitations without sacrificing inference efficiency.

Interesting conceptual motivation.\nThe idea of explicitly regularizing intermediate representations to mitigate redundancy between layers is meaningful and timely, connecting to active discussions on representational collapse, information bottlenecks, and interpretability in Transformers.\n\n2. Theoretical framing of the residual bottleneck. \nThe paper makes a valuable attempt to formally characterize the residual bottleneck through mathematical and information-theoretic analysis, providing a principled foundation for the proposed architectural modifications.\n\n3. Training-only auxiliary design.\nRemoving REFORM at inference time is appealing from a practical standpoint: it avoids additional inference cost while potentially improving training dynamics and generalization.\n\n4. Variety of representational metrics.\nThe inclusion of different quantitative measures (MAE, SVCCA, effective rank, log-det covariance) shows an attempt to explore multiple facets of representational diversity rather than relying on a single proxy.\n\n5. Clear ablation intent.\nThe paper does perform ablations across layer groups and some loss components, suggesting awareness of architectural sensitivity, even though the results are not fully consistent or clearly presented.\n\n6. Potential to inspire follow-up work.\nThe overall framing - explicitly penalizing representational redundancy between Transformer layers - could inspire further research in regularization, model interpretability, or modular architectures."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "1. Lack of clarity and consistency in metric introduction.\nThe paper begins by defining mean attention entropy (MAE) but immediately introduces other measures such as SVCCA and covariance-based metrics without clear definitions or context. Later, effective rank and log-determinant covariance appear with little explanation. As a result, it remains unclear how these metrics jointly quantify the “representation bottleneck” or why they are meaningful proxies for representational diversity.\n\n2. Neglect of the MLP component.\nThe analysis and motivation focus almost entirely on the attention mechanism, with no discussion of the MLP sublayer in Transformers. It is unclear whether REFORM interacts with or aggregates representations that include MLP outputs, and if not, why this major component is omitted. The precise integration point of REFORM (after attention, after MLP, or after each full Transformer block) is never explicitly stated.\n\n3. Overly technical and poorly structured mathematical exposition.\nSection 3 presents dense, notation-heavy derivations without properly introducing symbols or providing intuition. Many variables are used before definition, and the section lacks high-level explanations linking the math to the problem of representational bottlenecks. This level of detail would be better suited for an appendix, as the current presentation interrupts readability.\n\n4. Unclear and under-justified design choices.\nThe motivation for dividing 32 layers into eight groups of four is not justified. Why exactly four layers per group, and why non-overlapping groups instead of a sliding or adaptive window? Similarly, fixed coefficients such as λ_ca = 0.1 are stated without reasoning or ablation. Several design and hyperparameter decisions appear arbitrary rather than empirically motivated.\n\n5. Ambiguous training-inference decoupling.\nREFORM is removed entirely during inference, yet the auxiliary losses (especially the orthogonality objective) are said to encourage complementary features between REFORM outputs and base model representations. It remains unclear how this complementary information is retained once REFORM is detached. The conceptual consistency of a “training-only” module that purportedly improves representation quality at inference is not well explained.\n\n6. Weak experimental rigor and limited interpretability of results.\nReported gains are small (often under 1%) and lack evidence of statistical significance. The number of test runs and sample sizes are not specified in the main text. Variance is only provided in the appendix, though it is crucial given the small margins. It is also unclear whether the “+Ours” models were trained from scratch or fine-tuned, which affects interpretability of the improvements. Figures 6-7 further illustrate this issue: differences between outputs are barely visible, yet the paper draws interpretive conclusions from them without statistical support.\n\n7. Presentation and formatting issues.\nTables and figures are inconsistently placed and labeled. Tables 1 and 2 appear in the Experimental Setting section rather than Results. The caption for Table 4 is formatted too close to Table 3 above it, which makes it appear as if it belongs to Table 3, this spacing issue creates confusion. Figure captions lack sufficient explanation (especially Figure 3, which should include a clearer architectural overview, and could benefit from adding a legend). Additionally, references are inconsistently formatted, with arXiv citations following different styles. Overall, the visual and textual layout could be significantly improved for clarity.\n\n8. Repetitive and unsynthesized discussion and conclusion.\nThe Discussion section primarily restates experimental findings without offering deeper analysis or synthesis. It could be merged with the Conclusion to improve cohesion and avoid redundancy."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Could the authors clarify how REFORM interacts with MLP sublayers? Is the representational diversity objective applied only to attention outputs, or to full block outputs?\n\n2. Since REFORM is removed at inference, what evidence supports that its training-induced representations retain complementary information rather than simply altering optimization dynamics?\n\n3. What motivated the decision to group every 4 layers together? Did the authors test overlapping groups or varying group sizes, and how sensitive are results to this choice?\n\n4. Reported gains are small (<1%). Could the authors provide variance over multiple runs or statistical significance tests to confirm reliability?\n\n5.

If I’m not mistaken, the authors’ argument in Figure 1 is that Llama3 exhibits greater representational capacity than Llama2 and Llama1, and that compared with Llama2 it displays more pronounced layer-wise variation in attention patterns; therefore, representational capacity relates not only to global entropy but also to layer-wise variation.
