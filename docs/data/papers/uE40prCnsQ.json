While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness in handling multiple mobile tasks simultaneously remains limited. Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo (Data Mixture Optimizer) – a novel solution employing a trainable network that predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark for mobile-task MLLMs, comprising 1,235 QA pairs spanning diverse real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong predictive capability (R²=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show DaMo achieves a 3.38\\% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench reveal DaMo’s superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57\\% in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47\\% than other methods. Notably, DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to other model architectures.", "tldr": "We propose a Data Mixing Optimizer in fine-tuning  multimodal LLMs for mobile phone  agents and introduce PhoneAgentBench which is a specialized benchmark for mobile-task evaluation.", "keywords": ["data mixing", "multitask", "fine-tuning", "multimodal", "agent"], "primary_area": "foundation or frontier models, including LLMs", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/46dbf816e14040ed2e985dbc1a60ef3f2947be1e.pdf", "supplementary_material": "/attachment/a90519adb75b007d2c88c1c9341baf6722d73b89.zip"}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper introduces DaMo (Data Mixture Optimizer), a learned MLP that predicts downstream task performance for a given data-mixture ratio and training step, enabling selection of near-optimal mixtures for multitask SFT of multimodal LLMs without exhaustively fine-tuning the base model.

The benchmark is more on the phone agent side with mixed problem.\n2. Although the claim lies on the no training of LLM in the model, the data collection process should be done repeatedly to collect mixture rate-performance pair for training the MLP optimizer. It involves querying MLLM for the tasks. The cost of this process is neglectable and should be audited to give better understanding of this approach. From paper, it requires 250 mixtures x 4 checkpoints to fit predictor at 250 samples. Table 2 reports 4225 H20-hours even in 250 sample setting. This cost may be prohibitive for many labs and partially offsets the claimed efficiency.\n3.  Static mixture shows the limitation of the model updating.
