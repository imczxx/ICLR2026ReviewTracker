Existing approaches, from retrieval-augmented generation frameworks to time-series architectures, operate through static information retrieval or linear temporal processing without the progressive abstraction layers essential for human-like reasoning. Here we introduce a bio-inspired cognitive memory system that transcends these limitations through a unified five-layer hierarchical framework that systematically abstracts information from sensory-level event encoding to meta-cognitive concept formation. Our architecture mirrors the brain's multi-timescale processing organization, implementing selective memory retention through biologically-motivated temporal decay mechanisms while integrating emotion-driven prioritization and circadian modulation. Unlike conventional systems that store unprocessed fragments, our approach employs subject-predicate-object triplets as abstraction carriers, combining enhanced PageRank algorithms with large language models to achieve dynamic memory consolidation that replicates hippocampal-neocortical interaction patterns. We validate this framework across two demanding temporal reasoning domains: financial forecasting using social media sentiment achieves state-of-the-art performance with information coefficients of 0.35 and Sharpe ratios of 5.52, surpassing neural architectures by substantial margins; e-commerce recommendation systems demonstrate perfect hit rates at both Hit@5 and Hit@10 metrics while maintaining NDCG@5 scores of 0.63; mental health screening from conversational data establishes new benchmarks in behavioral pattern recognition and disorder classification. The system's hierarchical abstraction capabilities enable superior long-term prediction across 30-day horizons while maintaining computational efficiency through biologically-inspired compression mechanisms. These results establish a transformative paradigm that bridges neuroscientific principles with practical artificial intelligence applications, offering a scalable framework for human-centered AI systems that maintains consistency with established mechanisms of biological memory processing and neural consolidation.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Bio-Inspired Learning", "Cognitive Architecture", "Time Series Learning"], "primary_area": "interpretability and explainable AI", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/701b601649f7c6f377e627a7cf2d49609c1689ab.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper proposes a “Hierarchical Bio-Inspired Cognitive Memory System,” which claims to mimic aspects of human cognition in order to support long-horizon behavioral prediction.

Focus on long-horizon prediction.  \nInstead of next-step forecasting, the paper explicitly targets horizons like T+15 to T+30 and claims only modest performance degradation at those ranges for tasks like stock movement prediction, which is a meaningful goal for sequential decision-making systems."}, "weaknesses": {"value": "### 1. The paper is very poorly presented and extremely hard to follow.\n\nThe main text is overloaded with neuroscience language (“amygdala-hippocampus gating,” “cortical consolidation,” “meta-cognitive concept formation,” “biologically constrained PageRank,” “circadian-modulated decay,” etc.). These terms are not meaningfully defined, core ideas are not clearly conveyed, and key algorithmic/architectural details are pushed into appendices. \nAt the top level, the reader is told there is a five-layer “cognitive pyramid” that mirrors cortical hierarchies from sensory encoding through meta-cognition, but in the body of the paper this is mostly described narratively, and only later (Appendix B.7) do we finally see step-by-step procedures per layer (e.g. “Layer 1: Initialize raw triplet graph… Apply temporal decay… Extract top-k1 salient nodes”; “Layer 4: Apply causal reasoning with temporal ordering constraints”), without definitions of some terms like “causal reasoning” or how “executive function modeling” is actually implemented. \nThe same issue appears in the forecasting module. The authors claim a unified temporal forecaster that fuses price, technical, emotion, and “hierarchical memory” inputs, with circadian-modulated positional encodings. But this is described using slogans in the main narrative and filled in only in Appendix C with equations and layer sizes. \nAs a result, the paper reads more like a manifesto than a clean scientific argument. Critical design decisions are scattered, terminology is often introduced in neuroscience metaphors rather than in precise ML language, and results are asserted in prose before the reader ever sees a formal problem definition. For ICLR, this is a presentation failure: it is genuinely difficult to extract what the model is, what is implemented vs. what is just inspiration, and how to reproduce it.\n\n### 2. The empirical evaluation lacks rigor and does not convincingly support the claims.\n\nThe paper reports extremely strong numbers — e.g. financial forecasting with an information coefficient of 0.35 and Sharpe ratio of 5.52 over 30-day horizons, plus >0.8 directional accuracy; and a recommender with “perfect” Hit@5 and Hit@10 (Hit@5 = Hit@10 = 1.00) and NDCG@5 = 0.63. \n\nHowever:\n* These are unusually high for the described problem settings, especially finance prediction at 30-day horizons from noisy multimodal inputs. The paper does not convincingly rule out leakage, optimistic backtesting, or artificially limited candidate sets. It does mention “time-series cross-validation with expanding windows: 60% train, 20% validation, 20% test,” but does not explain how this interacts with market reality (e.g. rolling transaction costs, turnover limits, etc.). \n* In the recommender study, the authors claim perfect Hit@5/Hit@10 while also needing to optimize multi-task objectives that include purchase classification, pacing, emotion regression, and ranking consistency. A system that can literally always put the “right thing” in the top 5 for all 13 users sounds more like re-ranking ground truth than open-world recommendation. The paper does not clearly say how large the candidate set is at inference time or whether evaluation is per-user on their own recent basket (which would make high Hit@K less surprising). \nWe do get precise metric formulas for finance (IC, Sharpe, Directional Accuracy, etc.) and recommendation (Hit@K, NDCG@K, AUC-ROC, AUC-PR). But we don’t get a persuasive argument that the evaluation setups are realistic or competitive. The results are described as “surpassing state-of-the-art neural architectures by substantial margins,” but the comparison baselines, data splits, and ablation checks that would justify such a conclusion are not shown in the main text, and apparently live (if anywhere) in supplemental detail that is not surfaced. \n\n### 3. The neuroscience narrative is overstated and mostly unverified.\n\nThe paper repeatedly claims direct analogies to biological systems (e.g. “amygdala-hippocampus gating for selective memory consolidation,” “cortical progressive abstraction,” “circadian-modulated temporal decay,” and “PageRank with biological dampening”) and argues that this biological grounding is what enables long-horizon prediction. But in practice, most of these mechanisms amount to engineered heuristics (thresholds, decay constants, PageRank with hand-weighted age and salience terms, Louvain-style clustering with temporal weights etc.). None of this is tied back to empirical neuroscience data in any falsifiable way - e.g. no evidence that the chosen circadian modulation coefficients match actual affective variation in the collected ECG/speech dataset; no demonstration that “emotion-weighted PageRank” is closer to human memory recall than a purely statistical attention baseline; no user study validating that the five memory layers correspond to human-interpretable “meta-cognitive concepts.” \nThe paper asserts that “integrating neurobiological principles” is what drives gains like Sharpe >5 and perfect Hit@5, but does not empirically isolate those principles. As written, a lot of the neuro framing reads like branding layered on fairly standard NLP/graph/time-series machinery, rather than a demonstrated scientific bridge between neuroscience and ML.\n\n### 4. There are no ablations demonstrating that each component is actually needed.\n\nThe system is described as a pipeline of dependent modules: physiological affect extraction → salience scoring with amygdala/hippocampus gating → multi-layer hierarchical memory → temporal forecaster. \nThe authors say each component is essential (e.g. physiological affect is “more objective” than self-report; hierarchical abstraction “mirrors cortical organization” and enables stable T+30 forecasting). But we never see:\n* A version without ECG/speech affect (e.g. text sentiment only).\n* A version without circadian/emotion-weighted salience (e.g. plain TF-IDF or attention scores).\n* A version without hierarchical memory (forecaster alone).\n* A version where the “five layers” collapse to one.\nWithout those ablations, the causal story (“this specific neuro-inspired bit is why we get those numbers”) is not established.\nThis matters because the claimed benefits are dramatic. If you say your design gives you Sharpe 5.52 on 30-day horizons, the bar for evidence that the design itself is responsible (not data leakage or a trivial shortcut) is extremely high. The paper does not clear that bar.\n\n### 5. Reproducibility, transparency, and ethics are weak.\n\nTo their credit, the authors do include a detailed description of the 31-day Taobao study: 13 users, 10,742 WeChat messages, categorization of messages (purchase intent / product inquiry / comparison / emotional response / general discussion), and 16,131 logged behavioral events across 6,305 items (page views, cart actions, purchases, etc.), plus post-study interviews that establish ground-truth purchase decisions and satisfaction ratings.\nBut:\n* For the affect module, they cite synchronized ECG and speech, and they state they achieve 95.95% accuracy on physiological emotion classification “surpassing human annotation reliability,” but they do not clearly explain the annotation protocol, the dataset provenance for that claim, or how that model generalizes beyond the 42-person (implied) interpersonal conversation setting.\n* For finance, we’re told that they integrate social/emotional signals and price/technical indicators into a Chronos-T5 backbone, and evaluate with time-series CV and Sharpe Ratio. But ticker list, market period, transaction cost assumptions, and portfolio construction are not described in the visible main text. \n* The recommender dataset cannot be released due to privacy, and only an “AI-synthesized dataset” will be shared. That means core claims depend on closed data, making independent verification difficult.\n* The paper says almost nothing about the ethical implications of running ECG- and conversation-driven affect modeling to predict and steer human behavior, or about consent and downstream use.\nGiven how strong and human-centric the claims are (“human-centered AI systems,” “mirroring cortical hierarchies,” “amygdala-hippocampus gating”), this lack of transparency and ethical discussion is worrying."}, "questions": {"value": "1. Clarity / readability: Can you rewrite the core method in straightforward ML terms (modules, inputs, outputs, training objectives, ablations) in the main body, rather than as neuroscience prose plus appendices?

It claims significant improvements in financial forecasting and recommendation systems. While the paper is ambitious and conceptually interesting, it exhibits several major weaknesses in rigour, reproducibility, and empirical validity. It reads more like a visionary position paper hidden as a technical contribution, with weak empirical support.\n\n1. The “Five-Layer Cognitive Pyramid” is vaguely defined. Each layer is named after cortical analogues but lacks mathematical formulation or clear operational definitions. The mapping between biological processes and computational mechanisms is superficial. For example, PageRank is arbitrarily described as a “biological consolidation” mechanism. The use of “biologically-inspired” terminology feels more decorative than mechanistic. Phrases like “amygdala-hippocampus gating” or “circadian-modulated decay” are not justified or backed by real neuroscientific modelling. Very confusing indeed!
