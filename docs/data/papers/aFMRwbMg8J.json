Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) have inspired the LLM-based CAD generation by representing CAD as command sequences. But these methods struggle in practical scenarios because command sequence representation does not support entity selection~(e.g. faces or edges), limiting its ability to support complex editing operations such as \\textit{chamfer} or \\textit{fillet}. \nFurther, the discretization of a continuous variable during \\textit{sketch} and \\textit{extrude} operations may result in topological errors.\nTo address these limitations, we present \\textbf{Pointer-CAD}, a novel LLM-based CAD generation framework that leverages a pointer-based command sequence representation to explicitly incorporate the geometric information of B-rep models into sequential modeling. In particular, Pointer-CAD decomposes CAD model generation into steps, conditioning the generation of each subsequent step on both the textual description and the B-rep generated from previous steps. Whenever an operation requires the selection of a specific geometric entity, the LLM predicts a \\textit{Pointer} that selects the most feature-consistent candidate from the available set. Such a selection operation also reduces the quantization error in the command sequence-based representation.\nTo support the training of Pointer-CAD, we develop a data annotation pipeline that produces expert-level natural language descriptions and apply it to build a dataset of approximately \\textbf{575K CAD models}.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate that Pointer-CAD effectively supports the generation of complex geometric structures and reduces segmentation error to the order of $10^{-3}$, \\textbf{a $100\\times$ improvement} over prior methods, thereby significantly mitigating the topological inaccuracies introduced by quantization error.", "tldr": "", "keywords": ["Text-to-CAD", "Command Sequnce Representation", "LLM", "Pointer"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Withdrawn Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/4bbdb39771900e094e2d46a6402f6c567725e138.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "The paper present Pointer-CAD - a novel method for text-conditioned CAD generation.

Conditional CAD generation is a well defined problem with dozens of methods on 3 main datasets (DeepCAD, Fusion360, and CC3D), and 3 main input modalities: point cloud (CAD-SIGNet, CAD-Recode, CAD-MLLM), images (Img2CAD, CADCrafter, CAD-GPT), and text (Text2CAD, Text-to-CadQuery, CAD-Coder, Cadrille). Instead of this authors come with their own benchmarks, namely Recap-DeepCAD and Recap-OmniCAD. This comparison is not enough for ICLR conference.\n  - The proposed pointer representation and autoregressive method are orthogonal to input modality, so the method is not limited to text inputs, and can be easily applied to point cloud or image modalities. Namely recent Cadrille and CAD-MLLM (cited in the paper) evaluate their approaches on all 3 modalities simultaneously. I think, to prove the importance of novel representation it is important to demonstrate such a comparisons.\n \n- Misleading and low metrics in main table.\n  - The baseline methods CADMium, DeepCAD, Text2CAD on both datasets are reported to achieve 40-50% of invalidity ratio (IR), which basically means that half of predictions are invalid, and the methods don't work. Recent text-to-cad approaches report order of magnitude better IR, namely 1% for Text2CAD, Cadrille, or Text-to-CadQuery. The proposed Pointer-CAD is also claimed to have up to 25% IR, basically not working either, on such simple datasets as DeepCAD.\n  - Authors report 3.38 median CD for Text2CAD method on ~DeepCAD dataset, however original Text2CAD reports as low as 0.37 mediand CD on the same data with different annotations. This sounds suspicious to me. Also proposed Pointer-CAD achieves 0.30 median CD on this data, with is I believe far from recent Text-to-CadQuery and Cadrille, reporting 0.22 median CD.\n  - All baseline methods are reported without chamfer F1 or fillet F1. I think before adding this to operations to novel Pointer-CAD it is important to show the results of adding them to previous methods. It should be straight forward for methods producing CadQuery code, because CadQuery supports these operations.\n\n- L.015: *\"... LLM-based CAD generation by representing CAD as command sequences.

This can be easily checked by prompting text- or image-conditioned CAD generation in CadQuery format.

However, mature parametric programming tools (e.g., CADQuery) already exist in the CAD domain, which can directly define chamfer operations through code. Such code generation modes may be more intuitive and eliminate the need for additional \"vector conversion modules\" to parse sequences into operations. The paper fails to compare the efficiency differences between \"sequence representation\" and \"code generation\": for instance, whether code generation can reduce \"sequence parsing errors,\" whether it is more easily adaptable to the native APIs of CAD software, and whether it is more efficient for complex models (with multiple chamfer edges or multi-parameter combinations). These issues remain unexplored.\nLimited extension of operation types, failing to cover complex scenarios such as \"subpart assembly\"The paper only extends CAD operations to three categories: \"sketch-extrusion,\" \"chamfering,\" and \"filleting,\" without involving more complex operation types in industrial modeling, especially \"subpart assembly\"—for example, positioning and assembling another predefined subpart on a specified surface (e.g., installing a bolt model on the top surface of a cube). Such operations not only require \"selecting the target surface\" but also involve handling more complex geometric relationships such as \"coordinate alignment between subparts and parent models\" and \"assembly constraints (e.g., fitting, coaxiality).\" The pointer mechanism of the existing framework only supports \"edge/face selection\" and cannot express assembly constraints; furthermore, the dataset does not include subpart annotations, and the model is not designed with generation logic for \"subpart calling and positioning,\" resulting in functionality limited to \"single part generation,\" which 难以满足 the assembly design requirements of actual products.\nDependence on B-rep historical information may lead to accumulation of multi-step errorsEach step generation in Pointer-CAD relies on the geometric information of the preceding B-rep. If a minor error occurs in a certain step (e.g., pointer selection deviation, inaccurate numerical parameters), subsequent steps will continue generating based on the erroneous B-rep, leading to error accumulation. For example: a deviation in the prediction of numerical tokens during the first extrusion step results in a smaller cube height; the second step selects the \"top surface\" of this cube for chamfering, which may fail due to insufficient top surface area. The paper does not evaluate the relationship between \"number of steps and error accumulation\" nor design an \"error correction mechanism\" (e.g., backtracking to adjust previous steps), which may pose a risk of precision degradation in multi-step complex models (with 10+ steps)."}, "questions": {"value": "See Weaknesses"}, "flag_for_ethics_review": {"value": ["No ethics review needed."]}, "rating": {"value": 2}, "confidence": {"value": 4}, "code_of_conduct": {"value": "Yes"}}, "id": "zYonkVapWU", "forum": "aFMRwbMg8J", "replyto": "aFMRwbMg8J", "signatures": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9122/Reviewer_qjCD"], "nonreaders": [], "readers": ["everyone"], "writers": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9122/Reviewer_qjCD"], "number": 4, "invitations": ["ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/Submission9122/-/Official_Review", "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Edit"], "domain": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference", "tcdate": 1761995578083, "cdate": 1761995578083, "tmdate": 1762920816195, "mdate": 1762920816195, "parentInvitations": "ICLR.cc/2026/Conference/-/Official_Review", "license": "CC BY 4.0", "version": 2}], "withdrawn": true}
