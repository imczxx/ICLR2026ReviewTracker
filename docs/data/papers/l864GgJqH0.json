While current generative models often treat molecular structures as rigid—using fixed atomic coordinates or abstract ligand features—they struggle to capture the continuous, interaction-driven nature of molecular recognition. To bridge this gap, we propose leveraging \\textit{electron density (ED)} — a continuous, physics-grounded representation encoding conformational ensembles and local chemical environments. We introduce \\textbf{ED-BFN}, an SE(3)-equivariant generative model that generates 3D molecular structures conditioned on sparse, pharmacophore-annotated point clouds derived from ligand ED. This approach provides a structure-aware prior without precise atom coordinates of protein structures. Unlike existing ED-based models, ED-BFN maintains strict spatial fidelity by aligning generated atoms with underlying electronic features. Evaluated on the DUD-E benchmark, ED-BFN recovers \\textbf{37/101} bioactive molecules under oracle setting (with ground-truth atom count provided) and \\textbf{28/101} in fully end-to-end setting (atom count predicted from electron density integral). Furthermore,\\textbf{ 45.7\\% }of generated poses achieve lower docking scores compared to reference redocking poses.To our knowledge, ED-BFN is the first generative model to represent electron density condition as a point cloud, and currently achieves state-of-the-art performance on bioactive molecule recovery and docking score improvement.", "tldr": "ED-BFN: First BFN-based model generating 3D molecules from electron density point clouds.

If it is a uniform sampling, then the density is basically just being used to define the isosurface of the molecular shape and the point cloud provides no density information.\n\nWhile I agree that ultimately all molecular properties stem from Schroedinger's equation, the densities generated with cctbx are not that. They are essentially a bunch of atom centered Gaussians. Furthermore, calculating these densities for ligands with cctbx does not result in a map that \"inherently captures conformational ensembles and local chemical environments\" - this would require using experimental data.

The paper lacks runtime or cost analysis, raising concerns about scalability to large datasets or Cryo-EM volumes.\n\n- Drug-likeness degradation: Generated molecules exhibit lower QED and higher SAS scores than baselines, implying weaker chemical realism despite better docking scores. The authors should analyze whether this stems from oversized structures or bias in the density-based conditioning.\n\n- ECloudGen as the primary baseline: Table 1 omits many key evaluation metrics for ECloudGen. It would be helpful to generate conformers (e.g., using RDKit) and perform redocking to report comparable redock scores.

This discrepancy could stem from differences in training data.
