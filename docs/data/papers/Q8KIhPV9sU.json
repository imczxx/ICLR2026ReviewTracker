Super-resolution (SR) has currently emerged as a popular manner to ease this issue. However, most existing SR methods fail to effectively exploit the synergism between frequency and spatial information, while also suffering from inadequate feature enhancement. In this work, we present a novel model for remote sensing image SR, termed as Spatial-Frequency Synergy Network (SFSN). Firstly, it holistically boosts hierarchical features from both the channel and spatial dimensions, through Adaptive Channel Shifting (AdaCS) and Multi-Scale Large Kernel Attention (MS-LKA), respectively. Meanwhile, a Dual-Domain Interaction Attention (DDIA) is devised to explicitly model the mutual effect between spatial and frequency domains, enabling synergic feature refinement and HR detail recovery. It also delivers a versatile solution for bridging the spatial-frequency domain gap in remote sensing SR tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets have demonstrated the superiority of our SFSN over advanced SR models quantitatively and qualitatively, while maintaining considerably low overhead.", "tldr": "A novel lightweight SR model for remote sensing images promoted by dual-domain interaction and holistic feature enhancement.", "keywords": ["Super-Resolution", "Remote Sensing", "Holistic Feature Enhancement", "Dual-Domain Feature Interaction"], "primary_area": "applications to computer vision, audio, language, and other modalities", "venue": "ICLR 2026 Conference Submission", "pdf": "/pdf/316dc93919d610efe8c62b04950de9a73ebef766.pdf", "supplementary_material": ""}, "replies": [{"content": {"summary": {"value": "This paper presents the Spatial-Frequency Synergy Network (SFSN), a novel architecture for remote sensing image super-resolution (RSISR).

What is the fundamental difference in the super-resolution process between RGB images in remote sensing scenes and RGB images in natural scenes? Why is it necessary to introduce frequency domain learning in remote sensing scenes, and how do specific network and module designs address the specific challenges and difficulties of super-resolution in remote sensing scenes?\n2. The core innovation of this paper is the introduction of frequency domain learning in the process of remote sensing image super-resolution, but the reasons behind this motivation have not been clearly explained. The reviewer has some questions regarding certain viewpoints mentioned in the second paragraph of the Introduction of this paper. This article mentions that CNN has significant flaws in RSI SR. This is because there are often repeated textures in RSI, and the image structure has significant heterogeneity. It should be noted that many datasets in natural scenes, such as DIV2K, Urban100, etc., also have duplicate textures in their images, and fixed texture features appear frequently in some images. If certain combinations of convolutional kernels can effectively recognize or extract features of a certain texture, then the sliding processing of convolutional kernels should be able to obtain the invariance of local information. In addition, the RSI mentioned here has significant heterogeneity, and the specific heterogeneity referred to is not clearly explained in this article, as well as the role of this heterogeneity in this article.\n3. Why build a large-sized kernel for feature extraction? Remote sensing images often have smaller targets. What is the purpose of proposing a large size kernel to solve in remote sensing scenarios?\n4. How does dual domain interaction solve the problem of long-range dependencies?\n5. Is the introduction of FFT operation in DDIA module specifically intended to enhance high-frequency information or low-frequency information? The author used convolution operations in the FFT module to extract feature information after FFT changes, and reconstructed it through iFFT without any interaction between frequency domain information and spatial features. Therefore, according to Fig. 4 and the explanation of DDIA, the reviewers understand that the core of this module is to build a branch of self attention like mechanism for learning spatial features and introduce FFT processing. However, during the interaction process, frequency domain signals were not explicitly used to enhance spatial features at low or high frequencies.

The paper lacks an analysis of remote-sensing image characteristics and whether the proposed modules exploit those properties. Can these modules transfer to natural images? I think it's necessary to conduct experiments on natural scene datasets (e.g., train on DIV2K and test on Set5, Set14, B100, Urban100, Manga109) to demonstrate the representation learning capabilities and generalization. The current comparison scheme gives readers the impression that the method performs poorly on natural scene datasets and was therefore reluctantly transferred to remote sensing datasets.\n\n2）The paper should include additional strong and classic baselines for comparison—e.g., DAT-Light, SeemoRe-L, HiT-SR, and CATANet—and evaluate on both remote-sensing and natural scene benchmarks to better validate the method’s competitiveness.\n\n3）The theoretical analysis is shallow; many equations merely restate network operations. For example, there is no in-depth theoretical analysis of why AdaCS is more effective than EARFA and PCS, failing to provide readers with a deep understanding of the proposed module's mechanism of action. The DDIA module has the same problem.\n\n4）The ablation studies are numerous but unfocused and omit crucial experiments. For instance, AdaCS’s effectiveness can be verified succinctly with three variants: ① without AdaCS, ② AdaCS replaced with PCS, and ③ AdaCS replaced with EARFA. It is recommended that the authors supplement and refine the key ablation experiments and present them in the main text.\n\n5）The paper's structure needs further optimization. For example, replace Figure 7 with visualizations figure of the DDIA ablation results. Furthermore, the visual performance comparison results (Figure 8) are not obvious. It is necessary to optimize the visual examples to highlight strengths.\n\n6）Fix minor errors and typos (e.g., “3×3 conv layers”).\n\n7）Model runtime is also a very important evaluation metric.
